      apropos [-dalv?V] [-e|-r|-w] [-s list] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-L locale] [-C file] keyword ...

Options (not all distributions support these options, run apropos -?)

   -a, --and
            Only display items that match all the supplied keywords.
            The default is to display items that match any keyword.

   -C file, --config-file=file
            Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

   -d, --debug
            Print debugging information.

   -e, --exact
            Each keyword will be exactly matched against the page names and the descriptions.

   -r, --regex
            Interpret each keyword as a regular expression.  This is the default
            behaviour.  Each keyword will be matched against the page names and
            the descriptions independently.
            It can match any part of either. The match is not limited to word boundaries.

   -w, --wildcard
            Interpret each keyword as a pattern containing shell style wildcards.
            Each keyword will be matched against the page names and the descriptions
            independently.  If --exact is also used, a match will only be found if an
            expanded keyword matches an entire description or page name.
            Otherwise the keyword is also allowed to match on word boundaries in the description.

   -l, --long
            Do not trim output to the terminal width.  Normally, output will be
            truncated to the terminal width to avoid ugly results from poorly-written NAME sections.


   -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
            If this system has access to other operating system\'s manual page
            descriptions, they can be searched using this option.
            To search NewOS\'s manual page descriptions, use the option -m NewOS.

            The system specified can be a combination of comma-delimited operating system names.
            To include a search of the native operating system\'s whatis descriptions, include
            the system name man in the argument string.
            This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

   -M path, --manpath=path
            Specify an alternate set of colon-delimited manual page hierarchies to search.
            By default, apropos uses the $MANPATH environment variable, unless it is empty or
            unset, in which case it will determine an appropriate manpath based on your
            $PATH environment variable.  This option overrides the contents of $MANPATH.

   -L locale, --locale=locale
            apropos will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function
            setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment variables, possibly including
            $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this
            option to supply a locale string directly to apropos.  Note that it will not take
            effect until the search for pages actually begins. Output such as the help message
            will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

   -s list, --sections=list, --section=list
            Search only the given manual sections.
            list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections.
            If an entry in list is a simple section, for example "3",
            then the displayed list of descriptions will include pages in sections "3",
            "3perl", "3x", and so on; while if an entry in list has an extension,
            for example "3perl", then the list will only include pages in that exact part
            of the manual section.

   -?, --help
            Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
            Print a short usage message and exit.

   -V, --version
            Display version information.

   -v, --verbose
            Print verbose warning messages.', 'bash');

Key
   file   A file containing commands to run, by default bash will read commands from standard input.

  In addition to the single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command,
  bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:

   -c string  Read commands are read from string.
              If there are arguments after string, they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with $0.

   -i         Interactive shell.

   -l         Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell, see INVOCATION below.

   -r         Restricted shell, see RESTRICTED SHELL below.

   -s         Commands are read from the standard input. The default if no file provided.
              This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell.

   -D         A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed on the standard output.
              These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not C
              or POSIX. This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.

   [-+]O [shopt_option]
              shopt_option is one of the shell options accepted by the shopt builtin.
              If shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O unsets it. If shopt_option is not supplied,
              the names and values of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on the standard output.
              If the invocation option is +O, the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.

   --         A -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing.
              Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments. An argument of - is equivalent to --.
              Bash also interprets a number of multi-character options. These options must appear on the command line
              before the single-character options to be recognized.

   --debugger  Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts.
              Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin)
              and shell function tracing (see the description of the -o functrace option to the set builtin). 

   --dump-po-strings Equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (portable object) file format.

   --dump-strings    Equivalent to -D. 

   --help           Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

   --init-file file
   --rcfile file
                    Execute commands from file instead of the standard personal initialization file ~/.bashrc
                    if the shell is interactive, see INVOCATION below.

   --login          Equivalent to -l.

   --noediting      Do not use the GNU readline library to read command lines when the shell is interactive.

   --noprofile      Do not read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or any of the personal initialization
                    files ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile.
                    By default, bash reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

Key
   -c --stdout      Compress or decompress to standard output.

   -d --decompress  Force decompression. bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat are really the same program,
                    and the decision about what actions to take is done on the basis of which
                    name is used. This flag overrides that mechanism, and forces bzip2 to decompress.

   -z --compress    The complement to -d: forces compression, regardless of the invokation name.

   -t --test        Check integrity of the specified file(s), but don\'t decompress them.
                    This really performs a trial decompression and throws away the result.

   -f --force       Force overwrite of output files. Normally, bzip2 will not overwrite existing
                    output files. Also forces bzip2 to break hard links to files, which it otherwise
                    wouldn\'t do. bzip2 normally declines to decompress files which don\'t have the
                    correct magic header bytes. If forced (-f), however, it will pass such files
                    through unmodified. This is how GNU gzip behaves.

   -k --keep        Keep (don\'t delete) input files during compression or decompression.

   -s --small       Reduce memory usage, for compression, decompression and testing. Files are
                    decompressed and tested using a modified algorithm which only requires 2.5 bytes
                    per block byte. This means any file can be decompressed in 2300k of memory, albeit
                    at about half the normal speed. During compression, -s selects a block size of
                    200k, which limits memory use to around the same figure, at the expense of your
                    compression ratio. In short, if your machine is low on memory (8 megabytes or less),
                    use -s for everything.

   -q --quiet       Suppress non-essential warning messages. Messages pertaining to I/O errors and
                    other critical events will not be suppressed.

   -v --verbose     Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each file processed. Further -v\'s
                    increase the verbosity level, spewing out lots of information which is primarily
                    of interest for diagnostic purposes.

   -L --license
   -V --version     Display the software version, license terms and conditions.

   -1 (or --fast) to -9 (or -best)
                    Set the block size to 100 k, 200 k ... 900 k when compressing. Has no effect when
                    decompressing. The --fast and --best aliases are primarily for GNU gzip
                    compatibility. In particular, --fast doesn\'t make things significantly faster.
                    And --best merely selects the default behaviour.

   --               Treats all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash.
                    This is so you can handle files with names beginning with a dash,
                    for example: bzip2 -- -myfilename.

   --repetitive-fast, --repetitive-best
                    These flags are redundant in versions 0.9.5 and above. They provided some coarse
                    control over the behaviour of the sorting algorithm in earlier versions, bzip now

     not changed.

     OWNER.GROUP
     OWNER:GROUP
     If the OWNER is followed by a colon or dot and a GROUP (a group
     name or numeric group id), with no spaces between them, the group
     ownership of the files is changed as well (to GROUP).

     OWNER.
     OWNER:
     If a colon or dot but no group name follows OWNER, that user is
     made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed
     to OWNER\'s login group.

     .GROUP
     :GROUP
     If the colon or dot and following GROUP are given, but the owner
     is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case,
     \'chown\' performs the same function as \'chgrp\'.

OPTIONS:

   The first option to cpio is a mode indicator:

      -i    Copy-in mode.  Read an archive from standard input (unless overriden) and extract the contents to disk
            or (if the -t option is specified) list the contents to standard output.
            If one or more file patterns are specified, only files matching one of the patterns will be extracted.

            Unlike in the shell, an initial \'.\' in a filename does match a wildcard at the start of a pattern, and
            a \'/\' in a filename can match wildcards.

      -o    Copy-out mode.  Read a list of filenames, one per line, from standard input and produce a new archive on standard output
            (unless overriden) containing the specified items.

      -p    Pass-Thru mode.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and copy the files to the specified directory.
            This combines the copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using an archive.
Options:

   Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in all operating modes.

   -0, --null
       Read filenames separated by NUL characters instead of newlines. (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)
       This is necessary if any of the filenames being read might contain newlines.
       GNU find is one way to produce a list of null-terminated filenames.

   -a, --reset-access-time
       Reset the access times of files after reading them, so that it does not look like they have just been read.
       (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)

   -A, --append
       Append to an existing archive. (Only works in copy-out mode.)
       The archive must be a disk file specified with the -O or -F (-file) option.

   -b, --swap
       Swap both halfwords of words and bytes of halfwords in the data. Equivalent to -sS.
       (may be used in copy-in mode.)
       Use this option to convert 32-bit integers between big-endian and little-endian machines. 

   -B
       Set the I/O block size to 5120 bytes. Initially the block size is 512 bytes. (copy-out mode only)

   --block-size=BLOCK-SIZE
       Set the I/O block size to BLOCK-SIZE * 512 bytes.

   -c  Identical to \'-H newc\', use the new (SVR4 ) portable format. (copy-out mode only)
       If you wish the old portable (ASCII ) archive format, use \'-H odc\' instead.

   -C IO-SIZE, --io-size=IO-SIZE
       Set the I/O block size to IO-SIZE bytes. (copy-out mode only.)

   -d, --make-directories
       Create leading directories where needed. (copy-in and pass-thru modes.)

   -E FILE, --pattern-file=FILE
       Read additional patterns specifying filenames to extract or list from FILE. (copy-in mode only.)
       The lines of FILE are treated as if they had been non-option arguments to cpio. This option is used in copy-in mode, 

   -f, --nonmatching
       Only copy files that do not match any of the given patterns. 

   -F, --file=archive
       Archive filename to use instead of standard input or output. (copy-in mode only.)
       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with \'HOSTNAME: \'.
       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an \'@\' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have
       permission to do so (typically an entry in that user\'s \'~/.rhosts\' file). 

   --force-local
       With -F, -I, or -O, take the archive file name to be a local file even if it contains a colon, which would
       ordinarily indicate a remote host name.

   -H FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
       Use archive format FORMAT. The valid formats are listed below; the same names are also recognized in all-caps.
       The default in copy-in mode is to automatically detect the archive format, and in copy-out mode is \'bin\'.

          \'bin\'    The obsolete binary format. 
          \'odc\'    The old (POSIX .1) portable format. 
          \'newc\'   The new (SVR4 ) portable format, which supports file systems having more than 65536 i-nodes. 
          \'crc\'    The new (SVR4 ) portable format with a checksum added. 
          \'tar\'    The old tar format. 
          \'ustar\'  The POSIX .1 tar format. Also recognizes GNU tar archives, which are similar but not identical. 
          \'hpbin\'  The obsolete binary format used by HPUX \'s cpio (which stores device files differently). 
          \'hpodc\'  The portable format used by HPUX \'s cpio (which stores device files differently). 

   -i, --extract
       Run in copy-in mode. see \'Copy-in mode\'. 

   -I archive
       Archive filename to use instead of standard input.
       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with \'HOSTNAME: \'.
       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an \'@\' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you
       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user\'s \'~/.rhosts\' file). 

   -k
       Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of cpio.

   -l, --link
       Link files instead of copying them, when possible.  (pass-thru mode only.)

   -L, --dereference
       Copy the file that a symbolic link points to, rather than the symbolic link itself.  (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)

   -m, --preserve-modification-time
       Retain previous file modification times when creating files. (copy-in and pass-thru modes.)

   -M MESSAGE, --message=MESSAGE
       Print MESSAGE when the end of a volume of the backup media (such as a tape or a floppy disk) is reached, to
       prompt the user to insert a new volume. (copy-in and copy-out modes.)
       If MESSAGE contains the string \'%d\', it is replaced by the current volume number (starting at 1). 

   -n, --numeric-uid-gid
       Show numeric UID and GID instead of translating them into names when using the \'--verbose option\'.
       (i mode, only with -t)

   --no-absolute-filenames
       Create all files relative to the current directory in copy-in mode, even if they have an absolute file name in the archive.

   --absolute-filenames\' (default)
       Do not strip leading file name components that contain \'..\' and leading slashes from file names in copy-in mode 

   --no-preserve-owner
       Do not change the ownership of the files; leave them owned by the user extracting them.
       This is the default for non-root users, so that users on System V don\'t inadvertently give away files.
       (This option can be used in copy-in mode and copy-pass mode.)

   -o, --create
       Run in copy-out mode. see \'Copy-out mode\'. 

   -O archive
       Archive filename to use instead of standard output. (Copy-out mode only)
       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with \'HOSTNAME: \'.
       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an \'@\' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you
       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user\'s \'~/.rhosts\' file). 

   --only-verify-crc
       Verify the CRC \'s of each file in the archive, when reading a CRC format archive.
       Don\'t actually extract the files. 

   -p, --pass-through
       Run in copy-pass mode. see \'Copy-pass mode\'. 

   --quiet
       Do not print the number of blocks copied.

   -r, --rename
       Interactively rename files. 

   -R [user][:.][group], --owner [user][:.][group]
       Set the ownership of all files created to the specified user and/or group in copy-out and copy-pass modes.
       Either the user, the group, or both, must be present. If the group is omitted but the \':\' or \'.\' separator is
       given, use the given user\'s login group. Only the super-user can change files\' ownership. 

   --rsh-command=COMMAND
       Notifies cpio that is should use COMMAND to communicate with remote devices. 

   -s, --swap-bytes
       Swap the bytes of each halfword (pair of bytes) in the files. (copy-in mode.)

   -S, --swap-halfwords
       Swap the halfwords of each word (4 bytes) in the files. (copy-in mode.)

   --sparse
       Write files with large blocks of zeros as sparse files. (copy-in and copy-pass modes.)

   -t, --list
       Print a table of contents of the input. (Copy-in mode only.)

   --to-stdout
       Extract files to standard output. (copy-in mode.)

   -u, --unconditional
       Replace all files, without asking whether to replace existing newer files with older files.
       (copy-in and copy-pass modes.)

   -v, --verbose
       List the files processed, or with \'-t\', give an \'ls -l\' style table of contents listing.
       In a verbose table of contents of a ustar archive, user and group names in the archive that do not exist
       on the local system are replaced by the names that correspond locally to the numeric UID and GID stored in the archive. 

   -V, --dot
       Print a \'.\' for each file processed. 

   --version
       Print the cpio program version number and exit.

   -A "agent string"
   --user-agent "agent string"
        Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
        To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
        quote marks. This can also be set with -H, --header option. (HTTP)

   -b name=data
   --cookie name=data
        Send the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data
        previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.
        The data should be in the format  "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

   -c filename
   --cookie-jar file name
        Save cookies to file after a completed operation.
        Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file

   --data "string"
        Send the specified data in an (HTTP) POST request, in the same way that a
        web browser does.
        This  will pass the data using the content-type
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

        -d, --data is the same as  --data-ascii.  To post data in pure binary, use --data-binary.
        To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

        Multiple date options will be merged together.
        Thus,  using  \'-d  name=daniel  -d skill=lousy\' would generate a post

   -f, --fail
        (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors.
        This is mostly done to enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts.
        In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document

   -i   The variable is to be treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see Shell Arithmetic)
        is performed when the variable is assigned a value.

        of any existing variable with the same name at a surrounding scope.
        If there is no existing variable, the local variable is initially unset.

   -A --show-all
         Output all changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, surrounding all conflicts with bracket lines.

   -e --ed
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE.

   -E --show-overlap

   -3 --easy-only
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, Output only nonoverlapping changes. 

   -m --merge
         Output merged file instead of ed script (default -A).
         Unlike piping the output from \'diff3\' to \'ed\', this works even for binary files and incomplete lines.

   -L LABEL --label=LABEL

   -i
         Append \'w\' and \'q\' commands at the end of ed scripts.
         This option must be combined with one of the \'-AeExX3\' options, and can not be combined with \'-m\'.

   -T --initial-tab
         Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.

   --strip-trailing-cr

   -b address
         Set the source IP address of the query to address.
         This must be a valid address on one of the host\'s network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or "::".
         An optional port can be specified by appending "#"

   -c class
         Over-ride the default query class (IN for internet).
         class is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for CHAOSNET records.

   -f filename 
         Operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from a file.
         The file contains a number of queries, one per line.
         Each entry in the file should be organised in the same way they would be presented
         as queries to dig using the command-line interface.

   -p port#
        Specify a non-standard port number to be queried,
        default = the standard DNS port number 53.
        This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured
        to listen for queries on a non-standard port number.

   -4   Force dig to only use IPv4 query transport.

   -6   Force dig to only use IPv6 query transport.

   -t type
        Set the query type to type, any valid query type which is supported in BIND9.
        The default query type "A", unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup.
        A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR.

        When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, type is set to ixfr=N.
        The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the
        serial number in the zone\'s SOA record was N.

   -x addr
        Reverse lookups - mapping addresses to names: addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-
        decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no need
        to provide the name, class and type arguments.
        dig automatically performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type
        and class to PTR and IN respectively.
        By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older RFC1886
        method using the IP6.INT domain specify the -i option.
        Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental and are not attempted.

   -k filename
        Sign the DNS queries sent by dig and their responses using transaction signatures (TSIG key file).
        You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line using the -y option;
        name is the name of the TSIG key and key is the actual key.
        The key is a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by dnssec-keygen(8).

        Caution should be taken when using the -y option on multi-user systems as the key can be visible in the
        output from ps(1) or in the shell\'s history file.
        When using TSIG authentication with dig, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and
        algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate key and server statements
        in named.conf.

   -i, --install package_file...
      Install the package. If --recursive or -R option is specified, package_file must refer to a directory instead.

      Installation consists of the following steps:

      1. Extract the control files of the new package.

      2. If another version of the same package was installed before the new installation,
         execute prerm script of the old package.

      3. Run preinst script, if provided by the package.

      4. Unpack the new files, and at the same time back up the old files,
         so that if something goes wrong, they can be restored.

      5. If another version of the same package was installed before the new installation, execute the postrm
         script of the old package. Note that this script is executed after the preinst script of the new package,
         because new files are written at the same time old files are removed.

      6. Configure the package. See --configure for detailed information about how this is done. 

   --unpack package_file...
      Unpack the package, but don\'t configure it.
      If --recursive or -R option is specified, package_file must refer to a directory instead. 

   --configure package...|-a|--pending
      Reconfigure an unpacked package.
      If -a or --pending is given instead of package, all unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.

      Configuring consists of the following steps:

        1. Unpack the conffiles, and at the same time back up the old conffiles, so that
           they can be restored if something goes wrong.

        2. Run postinst script, if provided by the package.

   --triggers-only package...|-a|--pending
      Processes only triggers. All pending triggers will be processed.
      If package names are supplied only those packages\' triggers will be processed, exactly once each where necessary.
      Use of this option may leave packages in the improper triggers-awaited and triggers-pending states.
      This can be fixed later by running: dpkg --configure --pending.

      Remove an installed package. -r or --remove remove everything except conffiles.
      This may avoid having to reconfigure the package if it is reinstalled later.
      (Conffiles are configuration files that are listed in the DEBIAN/conffiles control file).
      -P or --purge removes everything, including conffiles.
      If -a or --pending is given instead of a package name, then all packages unpacked, but marked to be removed or
      purged in file /var/lib/dpkg/status, are removed or purged, respectively.

      Note: some configuration files might be unknown to dpkg because they are created and handled separately through
      the configuration scripts. In that case, dpkg won\'t remove them by itself, but the package\'s postrm script
      (which is called by dpkg), has to take care of their removal during purge.

      Removing of a package consists of the following steps:
        1. Run prerm script
        2. Remove the installed files
        3. Run postrm script

   --update-avail, --merge-avail Packages-file
      Update dpkg\'s and dselect\'s idea of which packages are available. With action --merge-avail, old information is
      combined with information from Packages-file. With action --update-avail, old information is replaced with
      the information in the Packages-file.
      The Packages-file distributed with Debian is simply named Packages.
      dpkg keeps its record of available packages in /var/lib/dpkg/available.

      A simpler one-shot command to retrieve and update the available file is dselect update.
      Note that this file is mostly useless if you don\'t use dselect but an APT-based frontend: APT has its own system to
      keep track of available packages.

   -A, --record-avail package_file...
      Update dpkg and dselect\'s idea of which packages are available with information from the package package_file.
      If --recursive or -R option is specified, package_file must refer to a directory instead.

   --forget-old-unavail
      Now obsolete and a no-op as dpkg will automatically forget uninstalled unavailable packages.

   --clear-avail
      Erase the existing information about what packages are available.

   -C, --audit
      Search for packages that have been installed only partially on your system.
      dpkg will suggest what to do with them to get them working.

   --get-selections [package-name-pattern...]
      Get list of package selections, and write it to stdout.
      Without a pattern, non-installed packages (i.e. those which have been previously purged) will not be shown.

   --set-selections
      Set package selections using file read from stdin.
      This file should be in the format \'package state\', where state is one of install, hold, deinstall or purge.
      Blank lines and comment lines beginning with \'#\' are also permitted.

   --clear-selections
      Set the requested state of every non-essential package to deinstall.
      This is intended to be used immediately before --set-selections, to deinstall any packages not in list
      given to --set-selections.

   --yet-to-unpack
      Searches for packages selected for installation, but which for some reason still haven\'t been installed.

   --print-architecture
      Print architecture of packages dpkg installs (for example, "i386").

   --compare-versions ver1 op ver2
      Compare version numbers, where op is a binary operator.
      dpkg returns success (zero result) if the specified condition is satisfied, and failure (nonzero result)
      otherwise. There are two groups of operators, which differ in how they treat an empty ver1 or ver2.
      These treat an empty version as earlier than any version: lt le eq ne ge gt.
      These treat an empty version as later than any version: lt-nl le-nl ge-nl gt-nl.
      These are provided only for compatibility with control file syntax: < << <= = >= >> >.

   --command-fd n
      Accept a series of commands on input file descriptor n.
      Note: additional options set on the command line, and thru this file descriptor, are not reset for subsequent
      commands executed during the same run.

   --help
      Display a brief help message.

   --force-help
      Give help about the --force-thing options.

   -Dh, --debug=help
      Give help about debugging options.

   --licence, --license
      Display dpkg licence.

   --version
      Display dpkg version information.

   -C, --compile   Write a magic.mgc output file that contains a pre-parsed version of the magic file or directory.
   -c, --checking-printout
                   Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file.
                   This is usually used in conjunction with the -m flag to debug a
                   new magic file before installing it.
   -e, --exclude testname
                   Exclude the test named in testname from the list of tests made to determine the file type.
                   Valid test names are:
                      apptype     EMX application type (only on EMX).
                      text        Various types of text files (this test will try to guess the text encoding,
                                  irrespective of the setting of the \'encoding\' option).
                      encoding    Different text encodings for soft magic tests.
                      tokens      Look for known tokens inside text files.
                      cdf         Print details of Compound Document Files.
                      compress    Check for, and looks inside, compressed files.
                      elf         Print ELF file details.
                      soft        Consult magic files.
                      tar         Examine tar files.
   -F, --separator separator
                   Use the specified string as the separator between the filename and
                   the file result returned. Defaults to \':\'.

   -f, --files-from namefile
                   Read the names of the files to be examined from namefile (one per line)
                   before the argument list. Either namefile or at least one filename argument
                   must be present; to test the standard input, use \'-\' as a filename argument.

   -h, --no-dereference
                   option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links).
                   This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not defined.

   -i, --mime      Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than the more
                   traditional human readable ones. Thus it might say \'text/plain; charset=us-ascii\'
                   rather than \'ASCII text\'. In order for this option to work, file
                   changes the way it handles files recognized by the command itself
                   (such as many of the text file types, directories etc), and makes
                   use of an alternative \'magic\' file. (See the FILES section, below).

   --mime-type, --mime-encoding
                   Like -i, but print only the specified element(s).

   -k, --keep-going
                   Don\'t stop at the first match, keep going. Subsequent matches will
                   have the string \'\\012- \' prepended.  (If you want a newline, see -r)

   -L, --dereference
                   option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option in ls
                   (on systems that support symbolic links).
                   This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.

   -m, --magic-file magicfiles
                   Specify an alternate list of files and directories containing magic.
                   This can be a single item, or a colon-separated list.
                   If a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or directory, it will be used instead.

   -N, --no-pad    Don\'t pad filenames so that they align in the output.

   -n, --no-buffer Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file. This is only useful if checking
                  a list of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

   -p, --preserve-date
                   On systems that support utime(2) or utimes(2), attempt to preserve the access time
                   of files analyzed, to pretend that file never read them.

   -r, --raw       Don\'t translate unprintable characters to \\ooo. Normally file translates unprintable
                   characters to their octal representation.

   -s, --special-files
                   Normally, file only attempts to read and determine the type of argument files which
                   stat(2) reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems,  because reading special files
                   can have peculiar consequences.
                   Specifying the -s option causes file to also read argument files which  are block or character
                   special files. This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in raw disk
                   partitions, which are block special files.
                   This option also causes file to disregard the file size as reported by stat(2) since on some
                   systems it reports a zero size for raw disk partitions.

   -v, --version   Print the version of the program and exit.
   -z, --uncompress

A simple example:
$ grep "Needle in a Haystack" /etc/*

Options
   -A NUM
   --after-context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches. 
   -a
   --text
       Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent
       to the --binary-files=text option.

   -B NUM
   --before-context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches.

   -b
   --byte-offset
       Print the byte offset within the input file before each line of output.

   --binary-files=TYPE
       If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains binary data, assume 
       that the file is of type TYPE. By default, TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs
       either a one-line message saying that a binary file matches, or no message if there
       is no match. If TYPE is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does not match;
       this is equivalent to the -I option. If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as
       if it were text; this is equivalent to the -a option.
       Warning: grep --binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can have nasty
       side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some
       of it as commands.

   --colour[=WHEN]
   --color[=WHEN]
       Surround the matching string with the marker from the GREP_COLOR environment variable.
       WHEN can be \'never\', \'always\', or \'auto\' e.g. --color=always       By default the matched text will be colored red.
       If grep is made to match several strings, all of the matches will be colored, one exception
       is the regex ^ (match beginning of every line), the beginning of a line has no length so will
       not be coloued.
       So to return all lines and colour only matches: egrep --color=always \'^|string1|string2\'

   -C NUM
   --context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of output context.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches. 
   -c
   --count
       Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
       With the -v, --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.

   -D ACTION
   --devices=ACTION
       If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it.
       By default, ACTION is read, which means that devices are read just as if they were
       ordinary files. If ACTION is skip, devices are silently skipped.

   -d ACTION
   --directories=ACTION
       If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.
       By default, ACTION is read, which means that directories are read just as if they
       were ordinary files. If ACTION is skip, directories are silently skipped.
       If ACTION is recurse, grep reads all files under each directory, recursively; this
       is equivalent to the -r option.

   -E
   --extended-regexp
       Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression.

   -e PATTERN
   --regexp=PATTERN
       Use PATTERN as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning with -.

   -F
   --fixed-strings
       Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines,
       any of which is to be matched.

   -f FILE
   --file=FILE
       Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line. The empty file contains zero
       patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

   -G
   --basic-regexp
       Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular expression This is the default.
 
   -H
   --with-filename
       Print the filename for each match.

   -h
   --no-filename
       Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched.

   --help
      Output a brief help message.

   -I
      Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is
      equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.

   -i
   --ignore-case
      Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input files.

   -L
   --files-without-match
      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
      no output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.

   -l
   --files-with-matches
      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
      output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.

   -m NUM
   --max-count=NUM
      Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.
      If the input is standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are
      output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after the last
      matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.
      This enables a calling process to resume a search. When grep stops after NUM matching
      lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.
      When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater
      than NUM. When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after
      outputting NUM non-matching lines.

   --mmap
      If possible, use the mmap(2) system call to read input, instead of the default
      read(2) system call. In some situations, --mmap yields better performance.
      However, --mmap can cause undefined behavior (including core dumps) if an input
      file shrinks while grep is operating, or if an I/O error occurs.

   -n
   --line-number
      Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file. 

   -o
   --only-matching
       Show only the part of a matching line that matches PATTERN.

   --label=LABEL
       Display input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file LABEL.
       This is especially useful for tools like zgrep, e.g. gzip -cd foo.gz |grep --label=foo something

   --line-buffered
       Use line buffering, it can be a performance penality.

   -P
   --perl-regexp
       Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression.

   -q
   --quiet, --silent
       Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.
       Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if an error
       was detected. Also see the -s or --no-messages option.

   -R
   -r
   --recursive
       Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the \'-d recurse\' option. 
       Not all grep implementations support -r and among those that do, the behaviour with symlinks may differ.

   --include=PATTERN
       Recurse in directories only searching file matching PATTERN. 
   --exclude=PATTERN
       Recurse in directories skip file matching PATTERN.
 
   -s
   --no-messages
       Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
       Portability note: unlike GNU grep, traditional grep did not conform to POSIX.2 ,
       because traditional grep lacked a -q option and its -s option behaved like
       GNU grep\'s -q option. Shell scripts intended to be portable to traditional grep
       should avoid both -q and -s and should redirect output to /dev/null instead.

   -U, --binary
       Treat the file(s) as binary. 
       By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, grep guesses the file type by looking at
       the contents of the first 32KB read from the file. If grep decides the file is a
       text file, it strips the CR characters from the original file contents
       (to make regular expressions with ^ and $ work correctly).
       Specifying -U overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed
       to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs
       at the end of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to fail.
       This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
 
   -u
   --unix-byte-offsets
       Report Unix-style byte offsets.
       This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text
       file, i.e. with CR characters stripped off. This will produce results identical to
       running grep on a Unix machine.
       This option has no effect unless -b option is also used; it has no effect on
       platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

   -V
   --version
       Print the version number of grep to standard error.
       This version number should be included in all bug reports (see below). 
   -v
   --invert-match
       Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines. 
   -w
   --word-regexp
       Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
       The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of
       the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character. Similarly, it
       must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent
       character. Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.

   -x
   --line-regexp
       Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line. 
   -y
       Obsolete synonym for -i.
   -Z
   --null
       Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that
       normally follows a file name. For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after
       each file name instead of the usual newline.
       This option makes the output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names
       containing unusual characters like newlines.
       This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and
       xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters. ', 'bash');

Options

   --stdout
   --to-stdout
   -c
        Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged. 
        If there are several input files, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members.
        To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them.

   --decompress
   --uncompress
   -d
        Decompress.

   --force
   -f
        Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple links or the corresponding file
        already exists, or if the compressed data is read from or written to a terminal.
        If the input data is not in a format recognized by \'gzip\', and if the option --stdout
        is also given, copy the input data without change to the standard ouput: let \'zcat\' behave as \'cat\'.

        If \'-f\' is not given, and when not running in the background, \'gzip\' prompts to verify whether
        an existing file should be overwritten.

   --help
   -h
        Print a help message describing the options, then quit.

   --list
   -l
        For each compressed file, list the following fields:

          compressed size:   size of the compressed file
          uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
          ratio:             compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
          uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

          The uncompressed size is given as \'-1\' for files not in \'gzip\' format.

   --license
   -L
        Display the \'gzip\' license then quit.

   --no-name
   -n
        When compressing, do not save the original file name and time stamp by default.
        (The original name is always saved if the name had to be truncated.)
        When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if present
        (remove only the \'gzip\' suffix from the compressed file name)
        and do not restore the original time stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file).
        This option is the default when decompressing.

   --name
   -N
        When compressing, always save the original file name and time stamp; this is the default.
        When decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp if present.
        This option is useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when
        the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer.

   --quiet
   -q
        Suppress all warning messages.

   --recursive
   -r
        Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names specified on the command line
        are directories, \'gzip\' will descend into the directory and compress all the files
        it finds there (or decompress them in the case of \'gunzip\').

   --suffix SUF
   -S SUF
        Use suffix SUF instead of \'.gz\'.
        Any suffix can be given, but suffixes other than \'.z\' and \'.gz\' should be avoided to avoid
        confusion when files are transferred to other systems.
        A null suffix forces gunzip to try decompression on all given files regardless of suffix, as in:

          gunzip -S "" *        (*.* for MSDOS)

        Previous versions of gzip used the \'.z\' suffix. This was changed to avoid a conflict with \'pack\'.

   --test
   -t
        Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

   --verbose
   -v
        Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed.

   --version
   -V
        Version. Display the version number and compilation options, then quit.

   --fast
   --best
   -N
        Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit N, where \'-1\' or \'--fast\'
        indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)  and \'--best\' or \'-9\' 
        indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression).

                   10baseT (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), AUI (external transceiver) and so on.
                   The special medium type of auto can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the
                   media. Again, not all drivers can do this. 

   [-]broadcast [addr]    If the address argument is given, set the protocol broadcast address
                          for this interface. Otherwise, set (or clear) the IFF_BROADCAST flag for
                          the interface. 

   [-]pointopoint [addr]  This keyword enables the point-to-point mode of an interface,meaning that 
                          it is a direct link between two machines with nobody else listening on it.
                          If the address argument is also given, set the protocol address of the other
                          side of the link, just like the obsolete dstaddr keyword does.
                          Otherwise, set or clear the IFF_POINTOPOINT flag for the interface. 

   hw class address    Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver supports
                       this operation. The keyword must be followed by the name of the hardware class
                       and the printable ASCII equivalent of the hardware address. Hardware classes
                       currently supported include ether (Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet and
                       netrom (AMPR NET/ROM). 

   multicast           Set the multicast flag on the interface. Not normally be needed as
                       the drivers set the flag correctly themselves. 

   address             The IP address to be assigned to this interface. 

   txqueuelen length   Set the length of the transmit queue of the device.
                       It is useful to set this to small values for slower devices with a high
                       latency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast bulk transfers from disturbing
                       interactive traffic like telnet too much.', 'bash');

         If a device name is entered on the command line, then statistics for it and all its partitions
         are displayed. Last, the ALL keyword indicates that statistics have to be displayed for all the block
         devices and partitions defined by the system, including those that have never been used.

   -x    Display extended statistics.
         This option works with post 2.5 kernels since it needs /proc/diskstats file or a mounted sysfs to get
         the statistics. This option may also work with older kernels (e.g. 2.4) only if extended statistics are
         available in /proc/partitions (the kernel needs to be patched for that).

OPTIONS

   -f, -family
       followed by protocol family identifier: inet, inet6 or link ,enforce the protocol family to use.
       If the option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other arguments.
       If the rest of the command line does not give enough information to guess the family, ip falls
       back to the default one, usually inet or any. link is a special family identifier meaning that
       no networking protocol is involved. 

   -4  shortcut for -family inet. (IPv4)

   -6  shortcut for -family inet6. (IPv6)

   -0  shortcut for -family link.
   -o, -oneline
       output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the \'\\\' character.
       This is convenient when you want to count records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output. 

   -r, -resolve
    use the system\'s name resolver to print DNS names instead of host addresses. 

   -s, -stats, -statistics
       output more information. If the option appears twice or more, the amount of information increases.
       As a rule, the information is statistics or some time values.

   -V, -Version
       print the version of the ip utility and exit.

   -i
   --ignore-case
      Ignore differences in case when comparing keys.  With this option, the lines of the

   -1 FIELD
   -j1 FIELD

  -2 FIELD
   -j2 FIELD

   -o FIELD-LIST...
      Construct each output line according to the format in FIELD-LIST.
      Each element in FIELD-LIST is either the single character \'0\' or has the form M.N where
      the file number, M, is \'1\' or \'2\' and N is a positive field number.

      A field specification of \'0\' denotes the join field.  In most cases, the functionality
      of the \'0\' field spec can be reproduced using the explicit M.N that corresponds to the join field.
      However, when printing unpairable lines (using either of the \'-a\' or \'-v\' options), there is no
      way to specify the join field using M.N in FIELD-LIST if there are unpairable lines in both files.
      To give \'join\' that functionality, POSIX invented the \'0\' field specification notation.

      The elements in FIELD-LIST are separated by commas or blanks.
      Multiple FIELD-LIST arguments can be given after a single \'-o\' option; the values of
      all lists given with \'-o\' are concatenated together.
      All output lines - including those printed because of any -a or -v option - are subject to
      the specified FIELD-LIST.

   -t CHAR
      Use character CHAR as the input and output field separator.

   --quiet  Do not complain if no processes were killed.
     
   -r
   --regexp Interpret process name pattern as an extended regular expression.
     
   -s signal
   -signal
   --signal signal
            Send signal instead of the default SIGTERM. See list below.
            e.g. -s 9 = SIGKILL

   -u user
   --user user
            Kill only processes the specified user owns. Command names are optional.

   -v
   --verbose
            Report if the signal was successfully sent.

   -V
   --version
            Display version information.
   -w
   --wait   Wait for all killed processes to die. killall checks once per second if any
            of the killed processes still exist and only returns if none are left.
            Note that killall can wait forever if the signal was ignored, had no effect, or
            if the process stays in zombie state. 

   -Z pattern
   --context pattern 
            Specify security context: kill only processes having security context that match
            with given expended regular expression pattern. Must precede other arguments on
            the command line. Command names are optional. (SELinux Only)

Key
     -c      The files are assumed to contain data produced by cifplot(1)

     -d      The files are assumed to contain data from tex (DVI format from
             Stanford).

     -f      Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as
             a standard FORTRAN carriage control character.

     -g      The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced
             by the plot routines (see also plot for the filters used by the
             printer spooler).

     -l      Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and
             suppresses page breaks.

     -n      The files are assumed to contain data from ditroff (device independent
              troff).

     -p      Use pr(1) to format the files (equivalent to print).

     -t      The files are assumed to contain data from troff(1) (cat photo-
             typesetter commands).

     -v      The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like
             the Benson Varian.

     These options apply to the handling of the print job:

     -P      Force output to a specific printer.  Normally, the default printer
             is used (site dependent), or the value of the environment
             variable PRINTER is used.

     -h      Suppress the printing of the burst page.

     -m      Send mail upon completion.

     -r      Remove the file upon completion of spooling. Can not be used with
             the -s option, due to security concerns.

     -s      Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool directory.
               The -s option will use symlink(2) to link data files
             rather than trying to copy them so large files can be printed.
             This means the files should not be modified or removed until they
             have been printed.

     The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:

     -#num   The quantity num is the number of copies desired of each file
             named.  For example,

                   lpr -#3 foo.c bar.c more.c

             would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies
             of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,

                   cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr -#3

             will give three copies of the concatenation of the files. Often a
             site will disable this feature to encourage use of a photocopier
             instead.

     -[1234]font
             Specifies a font to be mounted on font position i. The daemon
             will construct a .railmag file referencing the font pathname.

     -C class
             Job classification to use on the burst page.  For example,

                   lpr -C EECS foo.c

             causes the system name (the name returned by hostname(1))  to be
             replaced on the burst page by EECS, and the file foo.c to be printed.

     -J job  Job name to print on the burst page.  Normally, the first file\'s name is used.

     -T title
             Title name for pr(1),  instead of the file name.

     -U user
             User name to print on the burst page, also for accounting purposes.
             This option is only honored if the real user-id is daemon
             (or that specified in the printcap file instead of daemon), and
             is intended for those instances where print filters wish to requeue jobs.

     -i [numcols]
             The output is indented. If the next argument is numeric (numcols),
             it is used as the number of blanks to be printed before each line;
             otherwise, 8 characters are printed.

     -wnum   Uses num as the page width for pr(1).', 'bash');

Options and arguments:

             Specify the queue associated with a specific printer (otherwise

     -       If a single \'-\' is given, lprm will remove all jobs which a user
             owns.  If the super-user employs this flag, the spool queue will
             be emptied entirely.

     user    Causes lprm to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to
             that user (or users).  This form of invoking lprm is useful only
             to the super-user.

     job#   A user can dequeue an individual job by specifying its job number.
            This number can be obtained from the lpq(1) program, e.g.

                   % lpq -l

                   % lprm 13

     If neither arguments or options are given, lprm will delete the currently
     active job if it is owned by the user who invoked lprm.

     lprm announces the names of any files it removes and is silent if there
     are no jobs in the queue which match the request list.

     lprm will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before removing any
     spooling files.  If a daemon is killed, a new one is automatically
     restarted upon completion of file removals.

Environment
     If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by lprm.

     PRINTER  If the environment variable PRINTER exists, and a printer has
              not been specified with the -P option, the default printer is
              assumed from PRINTER.

      lspci [options] 

Key
   Basic display modes:

   -m   Dump PCI device data in a backward-compatible machine readable form. See below for details.
   -mm  Dump PCI device data in a machine readable form for easy parsing by scripts. See below for details.
   -t   Show a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges, devices and connections between them.

   Display options:

   -v   Be verbose and display detailed information about all devices.
   -vv  Be very verbose and display more details. This level includes everything deemed useful.
   -vvv Be even more verbose and display everything we are able to parse, even if it doesn\'t
        look interesting at all (e.g., undefined memory regions).
   -k   Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel modules capable of handling it.
        Turned on by default when -v is given in the normal mode of output.
        (Currently works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)
   -x   Show hexadecimal dump of the standard part of the configuration space
        (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for CardBus bridges).
   -xxx Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI configuration space.
        It is available only to root as several PCI devices crash when you try to read some parts
        of the config space (this behavior probably doesn\'t violate the PCI standard, but it\'s at
        least very stupid). However, such devices are rare, so you needn\'t worry much.
   -xxxx Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte) PCI configuration space available
         on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.
   -b   Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the
        PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.
   -D   Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci suppresses them on machines which have only domain 0.

   Options to control resolving ID\'s to names:

   -n   Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them up in the PCI ID list.
   -nn  Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.
   -q   Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a device is not found in the local pci.ids file.
        If the DNS query succeeds, the result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it is recognized in
        subsequent runs even if -q is not given any more. Please use this switch inside automated scripts
        only with caution to avoid overloading the database servers.
   -qq  Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.
   -Q   Query the central database even for entries which are recognized locally.
        Use this if you suspect that the displayed entry is wrong.

   Options for selection of devices:

   -s [[[[domain]:]bus]:][slot][.[func]]
           Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine has several host bridges,
           they can either share a common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI domain of
           its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7).
           Each component of the device address can be omitted or set to "*", both meaning "any value".
           All numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0" means all
           functions of device 0 on any bus, "0.3" selects third function of device 0 on  all buses
           and ".4" shows only the fourth function of each device. 
   -d [vendor]:[device]
           Show only devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both ID\'s are given in hexadecimal and
           may be omitted or given as "*", both meaning "any value". 

   Other options:

   -i file
           Use file as the PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids. 
   -p file
           Use file as the map of PCI ID\'s handled by kernel modules.
           By default, lspci uses /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap.
           Applies only to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.

   -M   Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of all PCI devices, including those behind
        misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful results only with a direct hardware access
        mode, which usually requires root privileges. Please note that the bus mapper only scans PCI domain 0.
   --version
        Shows lspci version. This option should be used stand-alone. 

   PCI access options:

        The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see pcilib(7) for details).
        You can use the following options to influence its behavior:
   -A method
        The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI hardware.
        By default, it uses the first access method available, but you can use this option to override
        this decision. See -A help for a list of available methods and their descriptions. 
   -O param=value
        The behavior of the library is controlled by several named parameters.
        This option allows to set the value of any of the parameters.
        Use -O help for a list of known parameters and their default values.

   -H1  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)

   -H2  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)

   -F file
        Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of devices and values of their
        configuration registers from the given file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x.
        This is very useful for analysis of user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the hardware configuration
        in any way you want without disturbing the user with requests for more dumps. 

   -G   Increase debug level of the library.', 'bash');

                [section] name ... 

Key:

   -C config_file  The configuration file to use; the default is /etc/man.config. (See man.config(5).) 

   -M path         The list of directories to search for man pages. Separate the directories with colons.
                   An empty list is the same as not specifying -M at all. See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES. 

   -P pager        Which pager to use. This option overrides the MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn
                   overrides the PAGER variable. By default, man uses /usr/bin/less -is. 

   -B              Which browser to use on HTML files. This option overrides the BROWSER environment variable.
                   By default, man uses /usr/bin/less-is,

   -H              Specify a command that renders HTML files as text. This option overrides the HTMLPAGER environment variable.
                   By default, man uses /bin/cat,

   -S section_list List is a colon separated list of manual sections to search. This option overrides the MANSECT environment variable.

   -a              By default, man will exit after displaying the first manual page it finds.
                   Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages that match name, not just the first.

   -c              Reformat the source man page, even when an up-to-date cat page exists.
                   This can be meaningful if the cat page was formatted for a screen with a different number of columns,
                   or if the preformatted page is corrupted.

   -d              Don\'t actually display the man pages, but do print gobs of debugging information.

   -D              Both display and print debugging info.

   -f              Equivalent to whatis.

   -F
   --preformat     Format only - do not display. 

   -h              Print a help message and exit.

   -k              Equivalent to apropos.

   -K              Search for the specified string in *all* man pages.
                   Warning: this can be very slow and can match multiple pages! It helps to specify a section.

   -m system       Specify an alternate set of man pages to search based on the system name given.

   -p string       Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff.
                   Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.
                   Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to designate
                   them: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).
                   This option overrides the MANROFFSEQ environment variable.

   -t              Use /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc to format the manual page, passing the output to stdout.
                   The default output format of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc is Postscript, refer to the
                   manual page of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc for ways to pick an alternate format.
                   Depending on the selected format and the availability of printing devices, the output may
                   need to be passed through some filter or another before being printed.

   -w
   --path          Don\'t actually display the man pages, but do print the location(s) of the files that
                   would be formatted or displayed. If no argument is given: display (on stdout) the list
                   of directories that is searched by man for man pages. If manpath is a link to man, then
                   "manpath" is equivalent to "man --path". 

   -W              Like -w, but print file names one per line, without additional information.
                   This is useful in shell commands like man -aW man | xargs ls -l

       This implies that the terminal does not have the ability to delete and
       insert multiple lines. VT102s and above have this ability.

   -b  Binary mode. Use this switch when you want to view files containing
       8 bit characters. most will display the file 16 bytes per line in

       consists of non-ascii characters. Sometimes this feature is not
       desirable since some terminals have a special interpretation for
       eight bit characters. The -k option turns off the automatic sensing.

Source_Options:

   -m   Move source file to target name. 
        Both must be on the same device. Will not move directories.
        If the source file is a symbolic link, moves the link without checking
        if the link\'s target from the new directory is different than the old.

   -x   same as -m, except cross-device moves are done by copying, then deleting source.
        When copying, sets the permission bits and file modification time of the target
        file to that of the source file.

   -r   Rename source file or directory to target name.
        The target name must not include a path: the file remains in the same directory
        in all cases. This option is the only way of renaming directories under mmv.

   -c   Copy source file to target name.
        Sets the file modification time and permission bits of the target file to that
        of the source file, regardless of whether the target file already exists.
        Chains and cycles (to be explained below) are not allowed.

   -o   Overwrite target name with source file.
        If target file exists, it is overwritten, keeping its original owner and
        permission bits. If it does not exist, it is created, with read-write permission
        bits set according to umask, and the execute permission bits copied from the
        source file. In either case, the file modification time is set to the current time.

   -a   Append contents of source file to target name.
        Target file modification time is set to the current time. If target file does not
        exist, it is created with permission bits set as under -o.
        Unlike all other options, -a allows multiple source files to have the same target name,
        e.g. "mmv -a \\*.c big" will append all ".c" files to "big".
        Chains and cycles are also allowed, so "mmv -a f f" will double up "f".

   -l   Link target name to source file.
        Both must be on the same device, and the source must not be a directory.
        Chains and cycles are not allowed.

   -s   Same as -l, but use symbolic links instead of hard links.
        For the resulting link to aim back at the source, either the source name
        must begin with a \'/\', or the target must reside in either the current or the
        source directory. If none of these conditions are met, the link is refused.
        However, source and target can reside on different devices, and the source can be a directory. 

   If no source_option is specified, the task is given by the command name under which mmv was invoked (argv[0]):
 
   command_name   default task
 
   mmv            -x (Move except cross device)

   -t      Send RFC 854 DON\'T and WON\'T responses to RFC 854 DO and WILL requests.
           This makes it possible to use nc to script telnet sessions.

   -T ToS  Specifies IP Type of Service (ToS) for the connection.
           Valid values are the tokens \'lowdelay\', \'throughput\', \'reliability\', or

   -U      Use Unix Domain Sockets.

   -u      Use UDP instead of the default option of TCP.

   -v      Give more verbose output.

   -w timeout
           If a connection and stdin are idle for more than timeout seconds,
           then the connection is silently closed.  The -w flag has no
           effect on the -l option, i.e. nc will listen forever for a con-

   -X proxy_version
           Requests that nc should use the specified protocol when talking

Options:

   host [server]
         Look up information for host using the current default server or using server,
         if specified. If host is an Internet address and the query type is A or PTR ,
         the name of the host is returned. If host is a name and does not have a trailing
         period, the default domain name is appended to the name. (This behavior depends
         on the state of the set options domain , srchlist , defname , and search.

         To look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to the name.

   server domain
   lserver domain
         Change the default server to domain ; lserver uses the initial server to look up
         information about domain while server uses the current default server.
         If an authoritative answer can\'t be found, the names of servers that might have 
         the answer are returned. 
   root
         Change the default server to the server for the root of the domain name space.
         Currently, the host ns.internic.net is used. (This command is a synonym for

          When output is directed to a file, hash marks are printed for every 50 records
          received from the server. 

   view filename
          Sort and lists the output of previous ls command(s) with more(1).

OPTIONS
   -a, --all
      This option can be used only with -S and causes show status for all users.

   -d, --delete
      Delete a user\'s password (make it empty). This is a quick way to disable
      a password for an account. It will set the named account passwordless.

   -e, --expire
      Immediately expire an account\'s password. This in effect can force a
      user to change their password at the user\'s next login.

   -h, --help
      Display help message and exit.

   -i, --inactive INACTIVE
      This option is used to disable an account after the password has been
      expired for a number of days. After a user account has had an expired
      password for INACTIVE days, the user may no longer sign on to the account.

   -k, --keep-tokens
      Indicate password change should be performed only for expired authentication
      tokens (passwords). The user wishes to keep their non-expired tokens as before.

   -l, --lock
      Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a  password by
      changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value
      (it adds a ´!´ at the beginning of the password).

      Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be able to
      login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key).
      To disable the account, administrators should use usermod --expiredate 1
      (this set the account\'s expire date to Jan 2, 1970).

      Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their password.

   -n, --mindays MIN_DAYS

      change password in REPOSITORY repository

   -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
      Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files
      from the CHROOT_DIR directory.

   -S, --status
      Display account status information. The status information consists of
      7 fields. The first field is the user\'s login name.
      The second field indicates if the user account has a locked password (L),
      has no password (NP), or has a usable password (P).
      The third field gives the date of the last password change. The next four
      fields are the minimum age, maximum age, warning period, and inactivity period
      for the password. These ages are expressed in days.

   -u, --unlock
      Unlock the password of the named account. This option re-enables a password
      by changing the password back to its previous value (to the value before using -l).

   -w, --warndays WARN_DAYS
      Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required.
      The WARN_DAYS option is the number of days prior to the  password expiring
      that a user will be warned that their password is about to expire.

   -x, --maxdays MAX_DAYS
      Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid. After MAX_DAYS, the 
      password is required to be changed.

Options

   -a         Audible ping. This removes the need to look at the ping output.

   -A         Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, 
              so that effectively not more than one (or more, if preload is set) unanswered probes
              present in the network. Minimal interval is 200msec for not super-user.
              On networks with low rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode. 

   -b         Allow pinging a broadcast address. 

   -B         Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address is bound to one selected when ping starts.

   -c count   Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.

   -d         Debug, Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

   -F flow_label  Allocate and set 20 bit flow label on echo request packets. (Only ping6).
                  If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow label.

   -f         Flood ping, output packets as fast as they come back or 100 times per second.

   -i wait    Set an interval of wait seconds between sending each packet. default=one second.
              Only super-user can set wait to values less 0.2 seconds.
              (incompatible with -f)

   -I interface address              Set source address to specified interface_address.
              Argument can be numeric IP address or name of device.
              Required when pinging an IPv6 link-local address.

   -l preload If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as
              possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.
              Only the super-user can select preload more than 3.

   -L         Suppress loopback of multicast packets.
              only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -n         Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
              names for host addresses.
   -p pattern
              Specify up to 16 \'pad\' bytes to fill out the packet sent.
              This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
              network. eg, \'-p ff\' will fill the packet sent with all ones.

   -q         Quiet output. Only display the summary lines at startup time and when finished.
 
   -Q tos     Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams. tos can be a decimal or hex number.
              Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. For detail see RFC1349 and RFC2474

   -R         Record route(IPv4 only). Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and
              display the route buffer on returned packets.
              Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes.
              Many hosts ignore or discard this option.
 
   -r         Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
              If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
              This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it
              (e.g., after the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

   -s packetsize
              The number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into
              64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.

   -S sndbuf  Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one packet. 
   -t ttl     Set the IP Time to Live. 
   -T timestamp_option              Set special IP timestamp options, either \'tsonly\' (only timestamps),
              \'tsandaddr\' (timestamps and addresses)
              or \'tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]]\' (timestamp prespecified hops). 
   -M hint    Select Path MTU Discovery strategy. hint can be either \'do\' (prohibit fragmentation,
              even local one), \'want\' (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large),
              or \'dont\' (do not set DF flag). 
   -U         Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour).
              Normally ping prints network round trip time, which can be different f.e. due to DNS failures.

   -v         Verbose output. ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.

   -w deadline
              A timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received.
              In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire
              or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from the network.

   -W timeout
              Time to wait for a response, in seconds.

Options
   -b, --backup
           Forces quotacheck to make backups of the quota file before writing the new data.

   -v, --verbose
           quotacheck reports its operation as it progresses. Normally it operates silently.
           If the option is specified twice, also the current directory is printed (note that printing can slow
           down the scan measurably).

   -d, --debug
           Enable debugging mode.
           It will result in a lot of information which can be used in debugging the program.
           The output is very verbose and the scan will be slow.

   -u, --user
           Only user quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified are to be checked.
           This is the default action.

   -g, --group
           Only group quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified are to be checked.

   -c, --create-files
           Don\'t read existing quota files. Just perform a new scan and save it to disk.
           quotacheck also skips scanning of old quota files when they are not found.

   -f, --force
           Forces checking and writing of new quota files on filesystems with quotas enabled.
           This is not recommended as the created quota files may be out of sync.

   -M, --try-remount
           This flag forces checking of filesystem in read-write mode if a remount fails.
           Do this only when you are sure no process will write to a filesystem while scanning.

   -m, --no-remount
           Don\'t try to remount filesystem read-only. See comment with option -M.

   -i, --interactive
           Interactive mode. By default quotacheck exits when it finds an error.
           In interactive mode user is asked for input instead. See option -n.

   -n, --use-first-dquot
           If the quota files become corrupted, it is possible for duplicate entries for a single user
           or group ID to exist. Normally in this case, quotacheck exits or asks user for input.
           When this option is set, the first entry found is always used (this option works in interactive mode too).

   -F, --format=format-name
           Check and fix quota files of specified format (ie. don\'t perform format auto-detection).
           This is recommended as detection might not work well on corrupted quota files.
           Possible format names are: vfsold Original quota format with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs,
           vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits,
           vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit quota limits and usage, rpc (quota over NFS),
           xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)

   -a, --all
           Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in /etc/mtab

Other name arguments are ignored.   -d delim             The first character of delim is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.
   -e        If the standard input is coming from a terminal, readline is used to obtain the line.

   -i text   If readline is being used to read the line, text is placed into the editing buffer before editing begins. 
   -n nchars             read returns after reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input.

   -N nchars
             read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line
             of input, unless EOF is encountered or read times out. Delimiter characters encountered in
             the input are not treated specially and do not cause read to return until nchars characters are read. 
   -p prompt             Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read             any input. The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
   -r        Do not treat a Backslash as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part             of the line. In particular, a backslash-newline pair can not be used as a line continuation.
             Without this option, any backslashes in the input will be discarded.
             You should almost always use the -r option with read.   -s        Silent mode. If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
   -t timeout             Cause read to time out and return failure if a complete line of input is not read             within timeout seconds. This option has no effect if read is not reading input from             the terminal or a pipe.
   -u fd     Read input from file descriptor fd.

Options

   Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument)
   can be combined into a single command line argument.

   -a
   --text Treat all files as text and compare them line-by- line,
          even if they do not appear to be text.

   -b
   --ignore-space-change
          Ignore changes in amount of white space.

   -B
   --ignore-blank-lines
          Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.

   -d
   --minimal
          Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.
          This makes sdiff slower (sometimes much slower).

   -H
   --speed-large-files
          Use heuristics to speed  handling of large files that have numerous scattered small changes.

   -i
   --ignore-case
          Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.

   -I regexp
          Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match regexp.

   --ignore-all-space
          Ignore white space when comparing lines.

   --ignore-matching-lines=regexp
          Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match regexp.

   -l
   --left-column
          Print only the left column of two common lines.

   -o file
   --output=file
          Put merged output into file. This option is required for merging.

   -s
   --suppress-common-lines
          Do not print common lines.

   -t
   --expand-tabs
          Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
          in the input files.

   -v
   --version
          Output the version number of sdiff.

   -w columns
   --width=columns
          Use an output width of columns.  Note that for historical reasons,
          this option is -W in diff, -w in sdiff.

          Remove the Default ACL. If no Default ACL exists, no warnings are issued. 

   -n, --no-mask
          Do not recalculate the effective rights mask. The default behavior of setfacl is to recalculate the ACL mask entry,

          All permissions of a complete directory subtree are restored using this mechanism.
          If the input contains owner comments or group comments, setfacl attempts to restore the owner and owning group.
          If the input contains flags comments (which define the setuid, setgid, and sticky bits), setfacl sets those
          three bits accordingly; otherwise, it clears them. This option cannot be mixed with other options except \'--test\'. 

   --test
          Test mode. Instead of changing the ACLs of any files, the resulting ACLs are listed. 

   -R, --recursive
          Apply operations to all files and directories recursively. This option cannot be mixed with \'--restore\'. 

   -L, --logical
          Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories. The default behavior is to follow symbolic link arguments, and
          skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.

   -P, --physical

      strace -c [ -D ] [ -e expr ]... [ -O overhead ] [ -S sortby ] [ command [ arg... ] ] 

Key
   -a column
       Align return values in a specific column (default column 40).

   -c  Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and report a summary on program exit.
       On Linux, this attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running in the kernel)
       independent of wall clock time. If -c is used with -f or -F (below), only aggregate
       totals for all traced processes are kept.

   -D  (Not available on SVR4 and FreeBSD.) Run tracer process as a detached grandchild,
       not as parent of the tracee. This reduces the visible effect of strace by keeping the
       tracee a direct child of the calling process.

   -d  Show some debugging output of strace itself on the standard error.

   -e expr
       A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace or how to trace them.
       The format of the expression is:
          [qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...
       where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, or write and value
       is a qualifier-dependent symbol or number. The default qualifier is trace. Using an
       exclamation mark negates the set of values. For example, -eopen means literally
          -e trace=open which in turn means trace only the open system call.
       By contrast, -etrace=!open means to trace every system call except open.
       In addition, the special values all and none have the obvious meanings.

       Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history expansion even inside quoted
       arguments. If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.

   -e trace=set
       Trace only the specified set of system calls.
       The -c option is useful for determining which system calls might be useful to trace.
       For example, trace=open,close,read,write means to only trace those four system calls.
       Be careful when making inferences about the user/kernel boundary if only a subset of
       system calls are being monitored. The default is trace=all.

   -e trace=file
       Trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument.
       You can think of this as an abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,... which is
       useful to seeing what files the process is referencing. Furthermore, using the
       abbreviation will ensure that you don\'t accidentally forget to include a call like lstat
       in the list. Betchya woulda forgot that one.

   -e trace=process
       Trace all system calls which involve process management. This is useful for watching
       the fork, wait, and exec steps of a process.

   -e trace=network
       Trace all the network related system calls.

   -e trace=signal
       Trace all signal related system calls.

   -e trace=ipc
       Trace all IPC related system calls.

   -e trace=desc
       Trace all file descriptor related system calls.

   -e abbrev=set
       Abbreviate the output from printing each member of large structures.
       The default is abbrev=all. The -v option has the effect of abbrev=none.

   -e verbose=set
       Dereference structures for the specified set of system calls. The default is verbose=all.

   -e raw=set
       Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system calls. This option has
       the effect of causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal. This is mostly
       useful if you don\'t trust the decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value
       of an argument.

   -e signal=set
       Trace only the specified subset of signals. The default is signal=all.
       For example, signal=!SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be traced.

   -e read=set
       Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from file descriptors
       listed in the specified set. For example, to see all input activity on file
       descriptors 3 and 5 use -e read=3,5. Note that this is independent from the normal
       tracing of the read(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.

   -e write=set
       Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data written to file descriptors
       listed in the specified set. For example, to see all output activity on file
       descriptors 3 and 5 use -e write=3,5. Note that this is independent from the normal
       tracing of the write(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write. 

   -E var=val
       Run command with var=val in its list of environment variables.

   -E var
       Remove var from the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on to the command. 

   -f  Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of
       the fork(2) system call.  On non-Linux platforms the new process is attached to as
       soon as its pid is known (through the return value of fork(2) in the parent process).
       This means that such children can run uncontrolled for a while (especially in the case
       of a vfork(2)), until the parent is scheduled again to complete its (v)fork(2) call.
       On Linux the child is traced from its first instruction with no delay. If the parent
       process decides to wait(2) for a child that is currently being traced, it is suspended
       until an appropriate child process either terminates or incurs a signal that would cause
       it to terminate (as determined from the child\'s current signal disposition).

       On SunOS 4.x the tracing of vforks is accomplished with some dynamic linking trickery.

   -ff If the -o filename option is in effect, each processes trace is written to filename.pid
       where pid is the numeric process id of each process. This is incompatible with -c, since
       no per-process counts are kept.

   -F  This option is now obsolete and it has the same functionality as -f.

   -h  Print the help summary.

   -i  Print the instruction pointer at the time of the system call.

   -o filename
       Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.
       Use filename.pid if -ff is used. If the argument begins with \'|\' or with \'!\' then the
       rest of the argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to it. This is
       convenient for piping the debugging output to a program without affecting the
       redirections of executed programs.

   -O overhead
       Set the overhead for tracing system calls to overhead microseconds. This is useful for
       overriding the default heuristic for guessing how much time is spent in mere measuring
       when timing system calls using the -c option. The accuracy of the heuristic can be
       gauged by timing a given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and comparing
       the accumulated system call time to the total produced using -c.

   -p pid
       Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing. The trace can be
       terminated at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal ( CTRL -C). strace will respond
       by detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it (them) to continue running.
       Multiple -p options can be used to attach to up to 32 processes in addition to command
       (which is optional if at least one -p option is given).

   -q  Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc. This happens automatically when output
       is redirected to a file and the command is run directly instead of attaching.

   -r  Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call. This records the time
       difference between the beginning of successive system calls.

   -s strsize
       Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32). Note that filenames are
       not considered strings and are always printed in full.

   -S sortby
       Sort the output of the histogram printed by the -c option by the specified criterion.
       Legal values are time, calls, name, and nothing (default time).

   -t  Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

   -tt If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

   -ttt  If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and the leading portion
         will be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

   -T  Show the time spent in system calls. This records the time difference between the
       beginning and the end of each system call.

   -u username
       Run command with the user ID , group ID , and supplementary groups of username.
       This option is only useful when running as root and enables the correct execution of
       setuid and/or setgid binaries. Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs
       are executed without effective privileges.

   -v  Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc. calls. These structures
       are very common in calls and so the default behavior displays a reasonable subset of
       structure members. Use this option to get all of the gory details.

   -V  Print the version number of strace.

   -x  Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.

   -xx Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.', 'bash');

   --fast
       Pass the \'-f\' option to the shell.  This probably only makes sense if the shell run
       is \'csh\' or \'tcsh\', for which the \'-f\' option  prevents reading the startup file (\'.cshrc\').
       With Bourne-like shells, the \'-f\' option disables file name pattern expansion (globbing),
       which is not likely to be useful.

   -l
   --login
       Make the shell a login shell.  This means the following.  Unset all environment variables except
       \'TERM\', \'HOME\', and \'SHELL\' (which are set as described above), and \'USER\' and \'LOGNAME\' (which
       are set, even for the super-user, as described above), and set \'PATH\' to a compiled-in default value.
       Change to USER\'s home directory.
       Prepend \'-\' to the shell\'s name, intended to make it read its login startup file(s).

   -m
   -p
   --preserve-environment
       Do not change the environment variables \'HOME\', \'USER\', \'LOGNAME\', or \'SHELL\'.
       Run the shell given in the environment variable \'SHELL\' instead of the shell from
       USER\'s passwd entry, unless the user running \'su\' is not the superuser

       A "restricted shell" is one that is not listed in the file \'/etc/shells\', or in

        not modify HOME (see set_home and always_set_home in sudoers(5)).

   -K  (sure kill) like kill (-k) except that it removes the user\'s timestamp
        entirely. Like -k, this option does not require a password.

   -L   list defaults, list out the parameters that can be set in a Defaults
        line along with a short description for each. This option is useful
        in conjunction with grep(1).

   -P   Preserve group vector, causes sudo to preserve the invoking user\'s
        group vector unaltered. By default, sudo will initialize the group
        vector to the list of groups the target user is in. The real and
        effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.

   -S   stdin, read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal.

   -V   Version, print the version number and exit.
        If the invoking user is already root the -V option will print out a
        list of the defaults sudo was compiled with as well as the machine\'s
        local network addresses.

   -a   Authentication type, use the specified authentication type when
        validating the user, as allowed by /etc/login.conf. The system
        administrator can specify a list of sudo-specific authentication
        methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry in /etc/login.conf.
        This option is only available on systems that support BSD
        authentication where sudo has been configured with the
        --with-bsdauth option.

   -b   Background, run the given command in the background.
        Note that if you use the -b option you cannot use shell
        job control to manipulate the process.

   -c   Class, run the specified command with resources limited by
        the specified login class. The class argument can be either a
        class name as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single \'-\' character.
        Specifying a class of -indicates that the command should be run
        restricted by the default login capabilities for the user the
        command is run as. If the class argument specifies an existing user
        class, the command must be run as root, or the sudo command must be
        run from a shell that is already root.
        This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes
        where sudo has been configured with the --with-logincap option.

   -e   Edit, instead of running a command, the user wishes to edit one
        or more files. In lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is
        used when consulting the sudoers file. If the user is authorized
        by sudoers the following steps are taken:
         1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the
            owner set to the invoking user.
         2. The editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables
            is run to edit the temporary files. If neither VISUAL nor EDITOR
            are set, the program listed in the editor sudoers variable is used.
         3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back
            to their original location and the temporary versions are removed. 
        If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
        Note that unlike most commands run by sudo, the editor is run with the
        invoking user\'s environment unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo is
        unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will receive
        a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary file. 

   -h   Help, print a usage message and exit.

   -i   Simulate initial login, run the shell specified in the passwd(5) entry
        of the user that the command is being run as. The command name argument
        given to the shell begins with a - to tell the shell to run as a login shell.
        sudo attempts to change to that user\'s home directory before running the shell.
        It also initializes the environment, leaving TERM unchanged, setting HOME ,
        SHELL , USER , LOGNAME , and PATH , and unsetting all other environment variables.
        Note that because the shell to use is determined before the sudoers file is
        parsed, a runas_default setting in sudoers will specify the user to run the
        shell as but will not affect which shell is actually run.

   -k   Kill, invalidates the user\'s timestamp by setting the time on it to the epoch.
        The next time sudo is run a password will be required.
        This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to
        revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file.

   -l   List, list out the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the user on the current host.

   -p   Prompt, allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one.
        The following percent (\'%\') escapes are supported:
         %u  expanded to the invoking user\'s login name
         %U  expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to root)
         %h  expanded to the local hostname without the domain name
         %H  expanded to the local hostname including the domain name
            (on if the machine\'s hostname is fully qualified or the fqdn sudoers option is set)
         %%  two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a single % character

  -s    Shell, runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is
        set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).

   -u   User, causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other than root.
        To specify a uid instead of a username, use #uid.
        Note that if the targetpw Defaults option is set (see sudoers(5)) it is
        not possible to run commands with a uid not listed in the password database.

   -v   Validate, sudo will update the user\'s timestamp, prompting for the user\'s password
        if necessary. This extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever
        the timeout is set to in sudoers) but does not run a command.

   General Options

   -Tname  Tell tabs which terminal type to use.
         If this option is not given, tabs will use the $TERM environment variable.
         If that is not set, it will use the ansi+tabs entry.

   -d    The debugging option shows a ruler line, followed by two data lines.
         The first data line shows the expected tab-stops marked with asterisks.
         The second data line shows the actual tab-stops, marked with asterisks.

   -n    This option tells tabs to check the options and run any debugging option,
         but not to modify the terminal settings.

   -V    Report the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exit.

   Implicit Lists

      Use a single number as an option, e.g., "-5" to set tabs at the given interval
      (in this case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.).
      Tabs are repeated up to the right margin of the screen.

      Use "-0" to clear all tabs.

      Use "-8" to set tabs to the standard interval.

   Explicit Lists

      An explicit list can be defined after the options (this does not use a "-").
      The values in the list must be in increasing numeric order, and greater than zero.
      They are separated by a comma or a blank, for example,

         tabs 1,6,11,16,21
         tabs 1 6 11 16 21

      Use a "+" to treat a number as an increment relative to the previous value, e.g.,
      tabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5

      which is equivalent to the 1,6,11,16,21 example.

   Predefined Tab-Stops

      POSIX defines several predefined lists of tab stops.

                  end-of-archive block).  This has the effect of adding the
                  files contained in the named file to the first archive,
                  rather than adding the second archive as an element of the
                  first.  Note: This option requires a rewritable tarfile,
                  tapes.  (see notes below)
   -c
   --create     Create a new archive (or truncate an old one) and write the named files to it.

   -d
   --diff
   --compare    Find differences between files in the archive and
                corresponding files in the file system.

   --delete     Delete named files from the archive.
                (Does not work on quarter-inch tapes).
   -r
   --append     Append files to the end of an archive.
                (Does not work on quarter-inch tapes).
   -t
   --list       List the contents of an archive; if filename arguments are
                given, only those files are listed, otherwise the entire
                table of contents is listed.

   --test-label   Test the archive volume label and exit

   -u
   --update     Append the named files if the on-disk version has a modification date
                more recent than their copy in the archive(if any). 
                Does not work on quarter-inch tapes.
   -x
   --extract
   --get        Extract files from an archive.  The owner, modification time, and file
                permissions are restored, if possible. If no file arguments are given,
                extract all the files in the archive.
                If a filename argument matches the name of a directory on the tape, that directory
                and its contents are extracted (as well as all directories under that directory).
                If the archive contains multiple entries corresponding to the same file (see the --append command
                above), the last one extracted will overwrite all earlier versions.

   -C, --directory=DIR     change to directory DIR

   -f, --file=ARCHIVE     use archive file or device ARCHIVE

   -j, --bzip2     filter the archive through bzip2

Key
   command
      The command to execute, this must not be a special built-in utility.
      Options must precede operands.

   --preserve-status
       Return the exit status of the managed command on timeout, rather than
       a specific exit status indicating a timeout.
       This is useful if the managed command supports running for an
       indeterminite amount of time.

   --foreground
       Don\'t create a separate background program group, so that the
       managed command can use the foreground TTY normally.
       This is needed to support timing out commands not started directly
       from an interactive shell, in two situations.

        1) command is interactive and needs to read from the terminal for example.
        2) The user wants to support sending signals directly
           to command from the terminal (like Ctrl-C for example) 

        Note in this mode of operation, any children of command will not be timed out.

   -k duration
   --kill-after=duration
       Ensure the monitored command is killed by also sending a ‘KILL’ signal, after
       the specified duration.
       Without this option, if the selected signal proves not to be fatal, timeout
       does not kill the command.

   -s signal
   --signal=signal
       Send this signal to command on timeout, rather than the default ‘TERM’ signal.
       signal can be a name like ‘HUP’ or a number. See Signal specifications. 

   duration is a floating point number followed by an optional unit:

       ‘s’ for seconds (the default)
       ‘m’ for minutes
       ‘h’ for hours
       ‘d’ for days

        A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.
        Note that the actual timeout duration is dependent on system conditions,
        which should be especially considered when specifying sub-second timeouts.

   --help
        Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit successfully.

   --version
        Print the version number, then exit successfully.

   --   Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated as operands
        even if they begin with -. For example, ‘sort -- -r’ reads from the file
        named -r. 

Exit status:

     124 if command times out
     125 if timeout itself fails
     126 if command is found but cannot be invoked

   -2\'  Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

   -8\'  Like -2, but indicates that the terminal supports 88 colours.

   -c shell-command
        Execute shell-command using the default shell.
        If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.
        This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.

   -f file
        Specify an alternative configuration file.
        By default, tmux loads the system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present,
        then looks for a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf.
        The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.

        If a command in the configuration file fails, tmux will report an error and exit without executing further commands.

   -L socket-name
        tmux stores the server socket in a directory under /tmp (or TMPDIR if set); the default socket is named default.
        This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be run.
        Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

        If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to recreate it.

   -l   Behave as a login shell.
        This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

   -q   Set the quiet server option to prevent the server sending various informational messages.

   -S socket-path
        Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.
        If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is ignored.

   -u   tmux attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of the LC_ALL,
        LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables to be set for the string "UTF-8".
        This is not always correct: the -u flag explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.

        If the server is started from a client passed -u or where UTF-8 is detected, the utf8 and status-utf8
        options are enabled in the global window and session options respectively.

   -v   Request verbose logging.
        This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.
        Log messages will be saved into tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory,
        where PID is the PID of the server or client process.

   -V   Report the tmux version.

   -V      Reports the version of ncurses which was used in  this  program, and exits.

   init    If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user\'s
           terminal exists (see -Ttype, above), output the terminal\'s initialization strings
           and turn tabs expansion on or off according to the specification in the entry

   reset   Instead of putting out initialization strings, the terminal\'s reset strings
           will be output if present (rs1, rs2, rs3, rf).  If the reset strings are not
           present, but initialization strings are, the initialization  strings will be
           output. Otherwise, reset acts identically to init.

   longname
           If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user\'s  terminal exists
           (see -Ttype above), then the long name of the terminal will be put out.
           The long name is the last name in the first line of the terminal\'s description in
           the  terminfo  database [see term(5)].

         Adds an IP source route gateway to the outgoing packet. Not useful, as
         most routers have disabled this for security reasons. 

   -i interface
         The interface through which traceroute should send packets.
         Default = select according to the routing table. 

   -m max_ttl
         The max no. of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. Default=30 hops

   -N squeries
         The number of probe packets sent out simultaneously. Sending several probes
         concurrently can speed up traceroute considerably. Default = 16
         Note that some routers and hosts can use ICMP rate throttling. In such a situation
         specifying too large number can lead to loss of some responses. 

   -n    Show numerical addresses; do not look up hostnames.
         (Useful if DNS is not functioning properly.)

   -p port
         For UDP tracing: the destination port base traceroute will use
         (the destination port number will be incremented by each probe).
         For ICMP tracing: the initial icmp sequence value (incremented by each probe).
         For TCP tracing: the (constant) destination port to connect. 
   -t tos
         For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and Precedence value.
         Useful values are 16 (low delay) and 8 (high throughput).
         Note that in order to use some TOS precendence values, you have to be super user.
         For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value. 

   -w waittime
         Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe (default 5.0 sec). 

   -q nqueries
         Set the number of probe packets per hop. Default = 3 

   -r    Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
         If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
         This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it. 

   -s source_addr
         Choose an alternative source address. You must select the address of one of the interfaces.
         Default = address of the outgoing interface. 

   -z sendwait
         Minimal time interval between probes (default 0). If the value is more than 10,
         then it specifies a number in milliseconds, else it is a number of seconds
        (float point values allowed too). Useful when some routers use rate-limit for icmp messages. 

   -A    Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print results directly after
         the corresponding addresses 

   -V    Print the version and exit.

   --help  Print help info and exit. 

   -4, -6  Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 traceouting. By default, the program will try
           to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically.

       Passed as an option to the shar file.  Many shell archive scripts

       argument to indicate that existing files should be overwritten.

       The option \'-f\' is provided for a more unique interface. Many programs
       (such as \'cp\' and \'mv\') use this option to trigger the  very same action.

   -e
   --exit-0
       This option exists mainly for people who collect many shell archives
       into a single mail folder.  With this option, \'unshar\' isolates each
       different shell archive from the others which have been put in the
       same file, unpacking each in turn, from the beginning of the file
       towards its end.  Its proper operation relies on the fact that
       many shar files are terminated by a \'exit 0\' at the beginning of a line.

       Option \'-e\' is internally equivalent to \'-E "exit 0"\'.

   -E STRING
   --split-at=STRING
       This option works like \'-e\', but it allows you to specify the string that
       separates archives if \'exit 0\' isn\'t appropriate.
 
       For example, noticing that most \'.signatures\' have a \'--\' on a line right
       before them, one can sometimes use \'--split-at=--\' for splitting shell
       archives which lack the \'exit 0\' line at end.  The signature will then be

Options
   --arg-file=file
   -a file
            Read items from file instead of standard input.
            If you use this option, stdin remains unchanged when commands are run.
            Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null. 

   -0
   --null
            Expect filenames to be terminated by NULL instead of whitespace, and the quotes and
            backslash are not special (every character is taken literally).
            Disables the end of file string, which is treated like any other argument.
            Useful when input items might contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes.
            The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this mode. 

   --delimiter=delim
   -d delim
            Input items are terminated by the specified character.
            Quotes and backslash are not special; every character in the input is taken literally. 
            Disables the end-of-file string, which is treated like any other argument.
            This can be used when the input consists of just newline-separated items,
            although it is almost always better to design your program to use --null where this
            is possible. The specified delimiter can be a single character, a C-style character
            escape such as \\n, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.
            Octal and hexadecimal escape codes are understood as for the printf command.
            Multibyte characters are not supported. 

   -E eof-str
            Set the end of file string to eof-str. If the end of file string occurs as a line of input,
            the rest of the input is ignored. If neither -E nor -e is used, no end of file string is used.
   --eof[=eof-str]
    -e[eof-str]
            This option is a synonym for the -E option. Use -E instead, because it is POSIX compliant
            while this option is not. If eof-str is omitted, there is no end of file string. 
            If neither -E nor -e is used, no end of file string is used. 

   --help
            Print a summary of the options to xargs and then exit.
   -I replace-str
            Replace occurrences of replace-str in the initial-arguments with names read from standard
            input. Also, unquoted blanks do not terminate input items; instead the separator is the
            newline character. Implies -x and -L 1.

   --replace[=replace-str]
    -i[replace-str]     This option is a synonym for -I replace-str if replace-str is specified, and
                        for -I{} otherwise. This option is deprecated; use -I instead.

   -L max-lines
            Use at most max-lines nonblank input lines per command line.
            Trailing blanks cause an input line to be logically continued on the next input line.
            Implies -x.

   --max-lines[=max-lines]
    -l[max-lines]
            Synonym for the -L option. Unlike -L, the max-lines argument is optional.
            If max-lines is not specified, it defaults to one. The -l option is deprecated since the
            POSIX standard specifies -L instead.

   --max-args=max-args
    -n max-args
            Use at most max-args arguments per command line. Fewer than max-args arguments will be used
            if the size (see the -s option) is exceeded, unless the -x option is given, in which case
            xargs will exit. 

   -p
   --interactive
            Prompt for confirmation before running each command line.
            Only run the command line if the response starts with \'y\' or \'Y\'. Implies -t.

   -P max
   --max-procs=max
            Allow no more than max processes to run at once.
            The default is 1. A maximum of 0 allows as many as possible to run at once.
            Use the -n option with -P; otherwise chances are that only one exec will be done. 

   -r
   --no-run-if-empty
            Do not run command if standard input contains only blanks.

   -s max
   --max-chars=max
            Allow no more than max characters per command line, including the command and
            initial-arguments and the terminating nulls at the ends of the argument strings.
            The largest allowed value is system-dependent, and is calculated as the argument length
            limit for exec, less the size of your environment, less 2048 bytes of headroom.
            If this value is more than 128KiB, 128Kib is used as the default value; otherwise, the
            default value is the maximum. 1KiB is 1024 bytes. 

   -t
   --verbose
            Print the command line (on standard error output) before executing it.

   -x
   --exit
            If the maximum size (as specified by -s) is exceeded, exit.

              Adjust self-extracting executable  archive.   A  self-extracting
              executable  archive  is created by prepending the SFX stub to an
              existing archive. The -A option tells zip to  adjust  the  entry
              offsets  stored in the archive to take into account this "preamble"
              data.

       Note: self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a  special  case.   At
       present, only the Amiga port of zip is capable of adjusting or updating
       these without corrupting them. -J can be used to remove the SFX stub if
       other updates need to be made.

       -AC
       --archive-clear
              [WIN32]   Once  archive  is  created  (and tested if -T is used,

              WARNING:  Once  the bits are cleared they are cleared.
              You might want to use the -sf show files option to store the list
              of  files  processed  in  case  the  archive  operation  must be
              repeated.  Also consider using the -MM must  match  option. Be
              sure to check out -DF as a possibly better way to do incremental
              backups.

       -AS
       --archive-set
              [WIN32]  Only include files  that  have  the  archive  bit  set.
              Directories  are  not stored when -AS is used, though by default
              the paths of entries, including directories, are stored as usual
              and can be used by most unzips to recreate directories.

              The  archive  bit  is set by the operating system when a file is
              modified and, if used with -AC, -AS can provide  an  incremental
              backup  capability.   However, other applications can modify the
              archive bit and it may not be  a  reliable  indicator  of  which
              files  have  changed since the last archive operation.  Alternative
              ways to create incremental backups are using -t to use file
              dates,  though  this won\'t catch old files copied to directories
              being archived, and -DF to create a differential archive.

       -B
       --binary
              [VM/CMS and MVS] force file to be read binary (default is text).

       -Bn    [TANDEM] set Edit/Enscribe formatting options with n defined as
              bit  0: Don\'t add delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
              bit  1: Use LF rather than CR/LF as delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
              bit  2: Space fill record to maximum record length (Enscribe)
              bit  3: Trim trailing space (Enscribe)
              bit  8: Force 30K (Expand) large read for unstructured files

       -b path
       --temp-path path
              Use  the specified path for the temporary zip archive.
              For example:

                     zip -b /tmp stuff *

              will put the temporary zip archive in the directory /tmp,  copying
              over stuff.zip to the  current directory when done. This option is
              useful when updating an existing archive and the file system
              containing this old archive does not have enough space to
              hold both old and new archives at the same time.  It can also be
              useful  when  streaming in some cases to avoid the need for data
              descriptors.  Note that using this option can require zip to take
              additional time to copy the archive file when done to the
              destination file system.

       -c
       --entry-comments
              Add one-line comments for each file.  File  operations  (adding,
              updating)  are  done  first, and the user is then prompted for a
              one-line comment for each file.  Enter the comment  followed  by
              return, or just return for no comment.

       -C
       --preserve-case
              [VMS]   Preserve  case  all  on VMS.  Negating this option (-C-)
              downcases.

       -C2
       --preserve-case-2
              [VMS]  Preserve case ODS2 on VMS.  Negating this  option  (-C2-)
              downcases.

       -C5
       --preserve-case-5
              [VMS]   Preserve  case ODS5 on VMS.  Negating this option (-C5-)
              downcases.

       -d
       --delete
              Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive.  For example:

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\\* \\*.o

              will remove the entry foo/tom/junk, all of the files that  start
              with  foo/harry/,  and all of the files that end with .o (in any
              path).  Note that shell pathname expansion  has  been  inhibited
              with  backslashes,  so  that zip can see the asterisks, enabling
              zip to match on the contents of the zip archive instead  of  the
              contents  of  the  current  directory.  (The backslashes are not
              used on MSDOS-based platforms.)  Can also use quotes  to  escape
              the asterisks as in

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk "foo/harry/*" "*.o"

              Not  escaping  the asterisks on a system where the shell expands
              wildcards could result in the asterisks  being  converted  to  a
              list  of  files  in  the current directory and that list used to
              delete entries from the archive.

              Under MSDOS, -d is case sensitive when it matches names  in  the
              zip  archive.  This requires that file names be entered in upper
              case if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.  (We  considered
              making this case insensitive on systems where paths were
              case insensitive, but it is possible the  archive  came  from  a
              system where case does matter and the archive could include both
              Bar and bar as separate files in the archive.)  But see the new
              option -ic to ignore case in the archive.

       -db
       --display-bytes
              Display  running  byte  counts  showing the bytes zipped and the
              bytes to go.

       -dc
       --display-counts
              Display running count of entries zipped and entries to go.

       -dd
       --display-dots
              Display dots while each entry is zipped (except  on  ports  that
              have  their  own progress indicator).  See -ds below for setting
              dot size.  The default is a dot every 10 MB of input  file  pro-
              cessed.   The -v option also displays dots (previously at a much
              higher rate than this but now -v also defaults  to  10  MB)  and
              this rate is also controlled by -ds.

       -df
       --datafork
              [MacOS] Include only data-fork of files zipped into the archive.
              Good  for  exporting   files   to   foreign   operating-systems.
              Resource-forks will be ignored at all.

       -dg
       --display-globaldots
              Display  progress dots for the archive instead of for each file.
              The command

                         zip -qdgds 10m

              will turn off most output except dots every 10 MB.

       -ds size
       --dot-size size
              Set amount of input file processed for each dot displayed.   See
              -dd to enable displaying dots.  Setting this option implies -dd.
              Size is in the format nm where n is a number and m is  a  multi-
              plier.  Currently m can be k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB), so
              if n is 100 and m is k, size would be 100k which is 100 KB.  The
              default is 10 MB.

              The -v option also displays dots and now defaults to 10 MB also.
              This rate is also controlled by this option.  A size of 0  turns
              dots off.

              This  option does not control the dots from the "Scanning files"
              message as zip scans for input files.  The dot size for that  is
              fixed  at  2  seconds or a fixed number of entries, whichever is
              longer.

       -du
       --display-usize
              Display the uncompressed size of each entry.

       -dv
       --display-volume
              Display the volume (disk) number each entry is being read  from,
              if reading an existing archive, and being written to.

       -D
       --no-dir-entries
              Do  not  create  entries  in  the  zip  archive for directories.
              Directory  entries  are  created  by  default  so   that   their
              attributes  can  be  saved  in the zip archive.  The environment
              variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default  options.  For
              example under Unix with sh:

                     ZIPOPT="-D"; export ZIPOPT

              (The  variable  ZIPOPT  can be used for any option, including -i
              and -x using a new option format detailed below, and can include
              several  options.)  The option -D is a shorthand for -x "*/" but
              the latter previously could not be set as default in the  ZIPOPT
              environment  variable  as  the  contents of ZIPOPT gets inserted
              near the beginning of the command line and the file list had  to
              end at the end of the line.

              This  version  of  zip does allow -x and -i options in ZIPOPT if
              the form

               -x file file ... @

              is used, where the @ (an argument that is just @) terminates the
              list.

       -DF
       --difference-archive
              Create  an archive that contains all new and changed files since
              the original archive was created.  For this to work,  the  input
              file  list  and current directory must be the same as during the
              original zip operation.

              For example, if the existing archive was created using

                     zip -r foofull .

              from the bar directory, then the command

                     zip -r foofull . -DF --out foonew

              also from the bar directory creates the archive foonew with just
              the  files  not  in foofull and the files where the size or file
              time of the files do not match those in foofull.

              Note that the timezone environment variable  TZ  should  be  set
              according to the local timezone in order for this option to work
              correctly.  A change in timezone since the original archive  was
              created  could  result  in no times matching and all files being
              included.

              A possible approach to backing up a directory might be to create
              a  normal  archive  of  the  contents of the directory as a full
              backup, then use this option to create incremental backups.

       -e
       --encrypt
              Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a  password  which
              is  entered  on  the terminal in response to a prompt (this will
              not be echoed; if standard error is not a  tty,  zip  will  exit
              with  an  error).   The  password prompt is repeated to save the
              user from typing errors.

       -E
       --longnames
              [OS/2] Use the .LONGNAME Extended Attribute (if found) as  filename.

       -f
       --freshen
              Replace  (freshen)  an existing entry in the zip archive only if
              it has been modified more recently than the version  already  in
              the zip archive; unlike the update option (-u) this will not add
              files that are not already in the zip archive.  For example:

                     zip -f foo

              This command should be run from the same  directory  from  which
              the  original zip command was run, since paths stored in zip archives
              are always relative.

              Note that the timezone environment variable  TZ  should  be  set
              according  to  the local timezone in order for the -f, -u and -o
              options to work correctly.

              The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do  with
              the  differences  between  the Unix-format file times (always in
              GMT) and most of the other operating systems (always local time)
              and  the  necessity  to  compare the two.  A typical TZ value is
              \'\'MET-1MEST\'\' (Middle European time  with  automatic  adjustment
              for \'\'summertime\'\' or Daylight Savings Time).

              The  format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET,
              hh is the difference between GMT  and  local  time  such  as  -1
              above, and DDD is the time zone when daylight savings time is in
              effect.  Leave off the DDD if there is no daylight savings time.
              For the US Eastern time zone EST5EDT.

       -F
       --fix
       -FF
       --fixfix
              Fix  the zip archive. The -F option can be used if some portions
              of the archive are missing, but  requires  a  reasonably  intact
              central  directory.   The input archive is scanned as usual, but
              zip will ignore some problems.  The resulting archive should  be
              valid, but any inconsistent entries will be left out.

              When  doubled  as in -FF, the archive is scanned from the begin-
              ning and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits
              between  the  archive members. The single -F is more reliable if
              the archive is not too much damaged, so try this option first.

              If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you
              must  use  -FF.   This  is  a change from zip 2.32, where the -F
              option is able to read a truncated archive.  The -F  option  now
              more  reliably  fixes  archives  with  minor  damage and the -FF
              option is needed to fix archives where -F might have been suffi-
              cient before.

              Neither  option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
              transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After  the  repair,
              the  -t option of unzip might show that some files have a bad CRC.
              Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the ar-
              chive using the -d option of zip.

              Note  that  -FF can have trouble fixing archives that include an
              embedded zip archive that was stored  (without  compression)  in
              the  archive  and,  depending  on  the  damage,  it can find the
              entries in the embedded archive rather than the archive  itself.
              Try -F first as it does not have this problem.

              The  format  of  the fix commands have changed.  For example, to
              fix the damaged archive foo.zip,

                     zip -F foo --out foofix

              tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to  the
              new  archive  foofix.zip.  If this doesn\'t work, as when the ar-
              chive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in  the  ar-
              chive are missed, then try

                     zip -FF foo --out foofixfix

              and  compare the resulting archive to the archive created by -F.
              The -FF option can create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on
              what  is damaged, you can then use the -F option to fix that ar-
              chive.

              A split archive with missing split files can be fixed  using  -F
              if  you  have the last split of the archive (the .zip file).  If
              this file is missing, you must use -FF to fix the archive, which
              will prompt you for the splits you have.

              Currently  the fix options can\'t recover entries that have a bad
              checksum or are otherwise damaged.

       -FI
       --fifo [Unix]  Normally zip  skips  reading  any  FIFOs  (named  pipes)
              encountered, as zip can hang if the FIFO is not being fed.  This
              option tells zip to read the contents of any FIFO it finds.

       -FS
       --filesync
              Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS.
              Normally  when  an  archive  is updated, new files are added and
              changed files are updated but files that no longer exist on  the
              OS  are not deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new
              mode that checks entries in the archive against the file system.
              If  the file time and file size of the entry matches that of the
              OS file, the entry is copied from the  old  archive  instead  of
              being  read from the file system and compressed.  If the OS file
              has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual.  If  the
              entry  in the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry
              is deleted.  Enabling this option should  create  archives  that
              are  the  same  as  new archives, but since existing entries are
              copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive  with
              -FS  can  be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also con-
              sider using -u for updating an archive.

              For this option to work, the archive should be updated from  the
              same  directory  it  was created in so the relative paths match.
              If few files are being copied from the old archive,  it  can  be
              faster to create a new archive instead.

              Note  that  the  timezone  environment variable TZ should be set
              according to the local timezone in order for this option to work
              correctly.   A change in timezone since the original archive was
              created could result in no times matching and  recompression  of
              all files.

              This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to pre-
              serve the original archive, make a copy of the archive first  or
              use  the  --out  option  to  output the updated archive to a new
              file.  Even though it might be slower, creating a new archive with
              a  new  archive name is safer, avoids mismatches between archive
              and OS paths, and is preferred.

       -g
       --grow
              Grow (append to) the specified zip archive, instead of  creating
              a  new one. If this operation fails, zip attempts to restore the
              archive to its original state. If the restoration fails, the ar-
              chive  might  become  corrupted.  This  option  is  ignored when
              there\'s no existing archive or when at least one archive  member
              must be updated or deleted.

       -h
       -?
       --help
              Display  the  zip  help information (this also appears if zip is
              run with no arguments).

       -h2
       --more-help
              Display extended help including more  on  command  line  format,
              pattern matching, and more obscure options.

       -i files
       --include files
              Include only the specified files, as in:

                     zip -r foo . -i \\*.c

              which  will include only the files that end in .c in the current
              directory and its subdirectories. (Note  for  PKZIP  users:  the
              equivalent command is

                     pkzip -rP foo *.c

              PKZIP  does  not  allow  recursion in directories other than the
              current one.)  The backslash avoids the shell filename substitu-
              tion,  so  that  the  name  matching  is performed by zip at all
              directory levels.  [This is for Unix and other systems  where  \\
              escapes  the  next character.  For other systems where the shell
              does not process * do not use \\ and the above is

                     zip -r foo . -i *.c

              Examples are  for  Unix  unless  otherwise  specified.]   So  to
              include  dir,  a directory directly under the current directory,
              use

                     zip -r foo . -i dir/\\*

              or

                     zip -r foo . -i "dir/*"

              to match paths such as dir/a and dir/b/file.c [on ports  without
              wildcard expansion in the shell such as MSDOS and Windows

                     zip -r foo . -i dir/*

              is  used.]   Note  that  currently  the trailing / is needed for
              directories (as in

                     zip -r foo . -i dir/

              to include directory dir).

              The long option form of the first example is

                     zip -r foo . --include \\*.c

              and does the same thing as the short option form.

              Though the command syntax used to require -i at the end  of  the
              command  line,  this  version  actually allows -i (or --include)
              anywhere.  The list of files terminates  at  the  next  argument
              starting with -, the end of the command line, or the list termi-
              nator @ (an argument that is just @).  So the above can be given
              as

                     zip -i \\*.c @ -r foo .

              for  example.   There must be a space between the option and the
              first file of a list.  For just one file you can use the  single
              value form

                     zip -i\\*.c -r foo .

              (no space between option and value) or

                     zip --include=\\*.c -r foo .

              as  additional  examples.  The single value forms are not recom-
              mended because they can be confusing  and,  in  particular,  the
              -ifile  format  can  cause  problems if the first letter of file
              combines with i to form a two-letter  option  starting  with  i.
              Use -sc to see how your command line will be parsed.

              Also possible:

                     zip -r foo  . -i@include.lst

              which  will  only include the files in the current directory and
              its  subdirectories  that  match  the  patterns  in   the   file
              include.lst.

              Files to -i and -x are patterns matching internal archive paths.
              See -R for more on patterns.

       -I
       --no-image
              [Acorn RISC OS] Don\'t scan through Image files.  When used,  zip
              will  not  consider Image files (eg. DOS partitions or Spark ar-
              chives when SparkFS is loaded) as  directories  but  will  store
              them as single files.

              For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive
              will result in a zipfile containing a directory  (and  its  con-
              tent)  while  using the \'I\' option will result in a zipfile con-
              taining a Spark archive. Obviously this second case will also be
              obtained (without the \'I\' option) if SparkFS isn\'t loaded.

       -ic
       --ignore-case
              [VMS,  WIN32]  Ignore  case when matching archive entries.  This
              option is only available on systems where the case of  files  is
              ignored.  On systems with case-insensitive file systems, case is
              normally ignored when matching files on the file system  but  is
              not  ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy), and simi-
              lar modes when matching against archive  entries  (currently  -f
              ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from systems
              where case does matter and names that are the  same  except  for
              case can exist in an archive.  The -ic option makes all matching
              case insensitive.  This can result in multiple  archive  entries
              matching a command line pattern.

       -j
       --junk-paths
              Store  just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do not
              store directory names. By default, zip will store the full  path
              (relative to the current directory).

       -jj
       --absolute-path
              [MacOS] record Fullpath (+ Volname). The complete path including
              volume will be stored. By default  the  relative  path  will  be
              stored.

       -J
       --junk-sfx
              Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.

       -k
       --DOS-names
              Attempt  to  convert  the  names  and paths to conform to MSDOS,
              store only the MSDOS attribute (just the  user  write  attribute
              from  Unix), and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though
              it was not); for compatibility with PKUNZIP  under  MSDOS  which
              cannot handle certain names such as those with two dots.

       -l
       --to-crlf
              Translate  the Unix end-of-line character LF into the MSDOS con-
              vention CR LF. This option should not be used on  binary  files.
              This  option can be used on Unix if the zip file is intended for
              PKUNZIP under MSDOS. If the input files already contain  CR  LF,
              this option adds an extra CR. This is to ensure that unzip -a on
              Unix will get back an exact copy of the original file,  to  undo
              the effect of zip -l.  See -ll for how binary files are handled.

       -la
       --log-append
              Append to existing logfile.  Default is to overwrite.

       -lf logfilepath
       --logfile-path logfilepath
              Open a logfile at the given path.  By default any existing  file
              at  that location is overwritten, but the -la option will result
              in an existing file being opened and  the  new  log  information
              appended  to any existing information.  Only warnings and errors
              are written to the log unless the -li option is also given, then
              all information messages are also written to the log.

       -li
       --log-info
              Include  information  messages, such as file names being zipped,
              in the log.  The default is to only include  the  command  line,
              any warnings and errors, and the final status.

       -ll
       --from-crlf
              Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.  This option
              should not be used on binary files.  This option can be used  on
              MSDOS  if the zip file is intended for unzip under Unix.  If the
              file is converted and the file is later determined to be  binary
              a warning is issued and the file is probably corrupted.  In this
              release if -ll detects binary in the first buffer  read  from  a
              file,  zip now issues a warning and skips line end conversion on
              the file.  This check seems to catch all  binary  files  tested,
              but  the original check remains and if a converted file is later
              determined to be binary that warning is  still  issued.   A  new
              algorithm  is  now  being  used for binary detection that should
              allow line end conversion of text files  in  UTF-8  and  similar
              encodings.

       -L
       --license
              Display the zip license.

       -m
       --move
              Move  the  specified  files into the zip archive; actually, this
              deletes the target directories/files after making the  specified
              zip  archive.  If a directory becomes empty after removal of the
              files, the directory is also  removed.  No  deletions  are  done
              until zip has created the archive without error.  This is useful
              for conserving disk space, but is potentially dangerous so it is
              recommended to use it in combination with -T to test the archive
              before removing all input files.

       -MM
       --must-match
              All input patterns must match at least one file  and  all  input
              files  found  must  be readable.  Normally when an input pattern
              does not match a file the "name not matched" warning  is  issued
              and  when  an  input file has been found but later is missing or
              not readable a missing or not readable warning  is  issued.   In
              either  case zip continues creating the archive, with missing or
              unreadable new files being skipped and files already in the  ar-
              chive remaining unchanged.  After the archive is created, if any
              files were not readable zip returns the OPEN error code  (18  on
              most  systems)  instead  of the normal success return (0 on most
              systems).  With -MM set, zip exits as soon as an  input  pattern
              is not matched (whenever the "name not matched" warning would be
              issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In  either  case
              zip exits with an OPEN error and no archive is created.

              This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped
              so any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.   It
              is less useful when used with wildcards, but zip will still exit
              with an error if any input pattern doesn\'t match  at  least  one
              file  and  if  any matched files are unreadable.  If you want to
              create the archive anyway and only need to know  if  files  were
              skipped, don\'t use -MM and just check the return code.  Also -lf
              could be useful.

       -n suffixes
       --suffixes suffixes
              Do not attempt to compress files named with the given  suffixes.
              Such files are stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,
              so that zip doesn\'t waste  its  time  trying  to  compress them.
              The  suffixes  are  separated  by either colons or semi- colons.
              For example:

                   zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo

              will copy everything from foo into foo.zip, but will  store  any
              files  that end in .Z, .zip, .tiff, .gif, or .snd without trying
              to compress them (image and sound files  often  have  their  own
              specialized compression methods).  By default, zip does not com-
              press     files     with     extensions     in     the      list
              .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.   Such files are stored directly in
              the output archive.  The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used
              to change the default options. For example under Unix with csh:

                   setenv ZIPOPT "-n .gif:.zip"

              To attempt compression on all files, use:

                   zip -n : foo

              The maximum  compression option -9 also attempts compression on
              all files regardless of extension.

              On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes  (3
              hex  digit format). By default, zip does not compress files with
              filetypes in the list DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives, CFS files  and
              PackDir files).

       -nw
       --no-wild
              Do not perform internal wildcard processing (shell processing of
              wildcards is still done by the shell unless  the  arguments  are
              escaped).   Useful if a list of paths is being read and no wild-
              card substitution is desired.

       -N
       --notes
              [Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS  filenotes  as  zipfile  com-
              ments.  They can be restored by using the -N option of unzip. If
              -c is used also, you are prompted for comments  only  for  those
              files that do not have filenotes.

       -o
       --latest-time
              Set  the  "last  modified" time of the zip archive to the latest
              (oldest) "last modified" time found among the entries in the zip
              archive. This  can  be  used  without any other operations, if
              desired. For example:

              zip -o foo

              will change the last modified time of foo.zip to the latest time
              of the entries in foo.zip.

       -O output-file
       --output-file output-file
              Process  the  archive  changes as usual, but instead of updating
              the existing archive, output the  new  archive  to  output-file.
              Useful for updating an archive without changing the existing ar-
              chive and the input archive must be a different  file  than  the
              output archive.

              This  option  can  be used to create updated split archives.  It
              can also be used with -U to copy entries from  an  existing  ar-
              chive to a new archive.  See the EXAMPLES section below.

              Another  use  is  converting  zip  files  from one split size to
              another.  For instance, to convert an archive  with  700  MB  CD
              splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:

                     zip -s 2g cd-split.zip --out dvd-split.zip

              which uses copy mode.  See -U below.  Also:

                     zip -s 0 split.zip --out unsplit.zip

              will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.

              Copy  mode  will  convert stream entries (using data descriptors
              and which should be  compatible  with  most  unzips)  to  normal
              entries  (which should be compatible with all unzips), except if
              standard encryption  was  used.   For  archives  with  encrypted
              entries,  zipcloak  will decrypt the entries and convert them to
              normal entries.

       -p
       --paths
              Include relative file paths as part of the names of files stored
              in  the  archive.  This is the default.  The -j option junks the
              paths and just stores the names of the files.

       -P password
       --password password
              Use password to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  THIS IS INSE-
              CURE!   Many  multi-user  operating systems provide ways for any
              user to see the current command line of any other user; even  on
              stand-alone  systems  there  is  always  the threat of over-the-
              shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext password as part  of  a
              command  line  in  an  automated script is even worse.  Whenever
              possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter pass-
              words.   (And  where  security  is  truly  important, use strong
              encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively
              weak standard encryption provided by zipfile utilities.)

       -q
       --quiet
              Quiet   mode;   eliminate  informational  messages  and  comment
              prompts.  (Useful, for example, in shell scripts and  background
              tasks).

       -Qn
       --Q-flag n
              [QDOS]  store information about the file in the file header with
              n defined as
              bit  0: Don\'t add headers for any file
              bit  1: Add headers for all files
              bit  2: Don\'t wait for interactive key press on exit

       -r
       --recurse-paths
              Travel the directory structure recursively; for example:

                     zip -r foo.zip foo

              or more concisely

                     zip -r foo foo

              In this case, all the files and directories in foo are saved  in
              a zip archive named foo.zip, including files with names starting
              with ".", since the recursion does not use the shell\'s file-name
              substitution  mechanism.  If you wish to include only a specific
              subset of the files in directory foo and its subdirectories, use
              the  -i  option  to specify the pattern of files to be included.
              You should not use -r with the name  ".*",  since  that  matches
              ".."   which will attempt to zip up the parent directory (proba-
              bly not what was intended).

              Multiple source directories are allowed as in

                     zip -r foo foo1 foo2

              which first zips up foo1 and then foo2, going down  each  direc-
              tory.

              Note  that  while  wildcards  to -r are typically resolved while
              recursing down directories in the file system, any -R,  -x,  and
              -i  wildcards are applied to internal archive pathnames once the
              directories are scanned.  To have wildcards apply  to  files  in
              subdirectories  when recursing on Unix and similar systems where
              the shell does wildcard substitution, either  escape  all  wild-
              cards  or put all arguments with wildcards in quotes.  This lets
              zip see the wildcards and match files  in  subdirectories  using
              them as it recurses.

       -R
       --recurse-patterns
              Travel  the directory structure recursively starting at the cur-
              rent directory; for example:

                     zip -R foo "*.c"

              In this case, all the files matching *.c in the tree starting at
              the  current  directory  are  stored  into  a  zip archive named
              foo.zip.  Note that *.c will match file.c, a/file.c and  a/b/.c.
              More than one pattern can be listed as separate arguments.  Note
              for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is

                     pkzip -rP foo *.c

              Patterns are relative file paths as they appear in the  archive,
              or  will after zipping, and can have optional wildcards in them.
              For example, given the current directory is foo and under it are
              directories foo1 and foo2 and in foo1 is the file bar.c,

                     zip -R foo/*

              will zip up foo, foo/foo1, foo/foo1/bar.c, and foo/foo2.

                     zip -R */bar.c

              will  zip  up  foo/foo1/bar.c.   See the note for -r on escaping
              wildcards.


       -RE
       --regex
              [WIN32]  Before zip 3.0, regular expression  list  matching  was
              enabled  by  default on Windows platforms.  Because of confusion
              resulting from the need to escape "[" and "]" in  names,  it  is
              now  off  by  default for Windows so "[" and "]" are just normal
              characters in names.  This option enables [] matching again.


       -s splitsize
       --split-size splitsize
              Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split
              archive  is  an archive that could be split over many files.  As
              the archive is created, if the size of the archive  reaches  the
              specified  split  size,  that split is closed and the next split
              opened.  In general all splits but the last will  be  the  split
              size  and  the last will be whatever is left.  If the entire ar-
              chive is smaller than the split size a  single-file  archive  is
              created.

              Split  archives  are  stored in numbered files.  For example, if
              the output  archive  is  named  archive  and  three  splits  are
              required,  the  resulting archive will be in the three files ar-
              chive.z01, archive.z02, and archive.zip.  Do not change the num-
              bering  of  these  files  or the archive will not be readable as
              these are used to determine the order the splits are read.

              Split size is a number  optionally  followed  by  a  multiplier.
              Currently  the  number  must  be an integer.  The multiplier can
              currently be one of k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), g (gigabytes),
              or  t  (terabytes).   As  64k is the minimum split size, numbers
              without multipliers default to megabytes.  For example, to  cre-
              ate  a  split  archive  called  foo with the contents of the bar
              directory with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning
              on CDs, the command:

                     zip -s 670m -r foo bar

              could be used.

              Currently  the  old  splits  of a split archive are not excluded
              from a new archive, but they can be specifically  excluded.   If
              possible,  keep  the  input  and output archives out of the path
              being zipped when creating split archives.

              Using -s without -sp as above creates all the splits  where  foo
              is  being  written,  in  this  case the current directory.  This
              split mode updates the splits as the archive is  being  created,
              requiring  all  splits to remain writable, but creates split ar-
              chives that are readable by any unzip that  supports  split  ar-
              chives.   See  -sp  below  for  enabling  split pause mode which
              allows splits to be written directly to removable media.

              The option -sv can be used to enable verbose splitting and  pro-
              vide details of how the splitting is being done.  The -sb option
              can be used to ring the bell when zip pauses for the next  split
              destination.

              Split  archives cannot be updated, but see the -O (--out) option
              for how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a  new
              archive.   A  split archive can also be converted into a single-
              file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the -s option:

                     zip -s 0 split.zip --out single.zip

              Also see -U (--copy) for more on using copy mode.

       -sb
       --split-bell
              If splitting and using split pause mode, ring the bell when  zip
              pauses for each split destination.

       -sc
       --show-command
              Show  the  command line starting zip as processed and exit.  The
              new command parser permutes the arguments, putting  all  options
              and  any values associated with them before any non-option argu-
              ments.  This allows an option to appear anywhere in the  command
              line  as  long as any values that go with the option go with it.
              This option displays the command line as zip sees it,  including
              any arguments from the environment such as from the ZIPOPT vari-
              able.  Where allowed, options later  in  the  command  line  can
              override options earlier in the command line.

       -sf
       --show-files
              Show  the  files  that  would  be  operated  on, then exit.  For
              instance, if creating a new archive, this will  list  the  files
              that  would  be  added.   If the option is negated, -sf-, output
              only to an open log file.  Screen display is not recommended for
              large lists.

       -so
       --show-options
              Show  all  available options supported by zip as compiled on the
              current system.  As this command  reads  the  option  table,  it
              should include all options.  Each line includes the short option
              (if defined), the long option (if defined), the  format  of  any
              value  that  goes with the option, if the option can be negated,
              and a small description.  The value  format  can  be  no  value,
              required  value,  optional value, single character value, number
              value, or a list of values.  The output of this  option  is  not
              intended  to  show  how  to  use  any  option but only show what
              options are available.

       -sp
       --split-pause
              If splitting is enabled with -s, enable split pause mode.   This
              creates split archives as -s does, but stream writing is used so
              each split can be closed as soon as it is written and  zip  will
              pause  between each split to allow changing split destination or
              media.

              Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to  remov-
              able  media, it uses stream archive format that might not be read-
              able by some unzips.  Before relying on splits created with -sp,
              test a split archive with the unzip you will be using.

              To  convert a stream split archive (created with -sp) to a stan-
              dard archive see the --out option.

       -su
       --show-unicode
              As -sf, but also show Unicode version of the path if exists.

       -sU
       --show-just-unicode
              As -sf, but only show Unicode version of  the  path  if  exists,
              otherwise show the standard version of the path.

       -sv
       --split-verbose
              Enable various verbose messages while splitting, showing how the
              splitting is being done.

       -S
       --system-hidden
              [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and hidden  files.
              [MacOS]  Includes finder invisible files, which are ignored oth-
              erwise.

       -t mmddyyyy
       --from-date mmddyyyy
              Do not operate on files modified prior to  the  specified  date,
              where  mm  is  the  month  (00-12),  dd  is the day of the month
              (01-31), and  yyyy  is  the  year.   The  ISO 8601  date  format
              yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted.  For example:

                     zip -rt 12071991 infamy foo

                     zip -rt 1991-12-07 infamy foo

              will  add  all the files in foo and its subdirectories that were
              last modified on or after 7 December 1991, to  the  zip  archive
              infamy.zip.

       -tt mmddyyyy
       --before-date mmddyyyy
              Do not operate on files modified after or at the specified date,
              where mm is the month (00-12),  dd  is  the  day  of  the  month
              (01-31),  and  yyyy  is  the  year.   The  ISO 8601  date format
              yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted.  For example:

                     zip -rtt 11301995 infamy foo

                     zip -rtt 1995-11-30 infamy foo

              will add all the files in foo and its subdirectories  that  were
              last  modified  before  30  November  1995,  to  the zip archive
              infamy.zip.

       -T
       --test
              Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails,  the
              old  zip  file  is  unchanged  and (with the -m option) no input
              files are removed.

       -TT cmd
       --unzip-command cmd
              Use command cmd instead of \'unzip -tqq\' to test an archive  when
              the  -T  option is used.  On Unix, to use a copy of unzip in the
              current directory instead of the standard  system  unzip,  could
              use:

               zip archive file1 file2 -T -TT "./unzip -tqq"

              In  cmd,  {}  is  replaced by the name of the temporary archive,
              otherwise the name of the archive is appended to the end of  the
              command.  The return code is checked for success (0 on Unix).

       -u
       --update
              Replace (update) an existing entry in the zip archive only if it
              has been modified more recently than the version already in  the
              zip archive.  For example:

                     zip -u stuff *

              will  add any new files in the current directory, and update any
              files which have been modified since the zip  archive  stuff.zip
              was  last  created/modified  (note that zip will not try to pack
              stuff.zip into itself when you do this).

              Note that the -u option with no input file arguments  acts  like
              the -f (freshen) option.

       -U
       --copy-entries
              Copy  entries  from  one archive to another.  Requires the --out
              option to specify a different output file  than  the  input  ar-
              chive.   Copy  mode is the reverse of -d delete.  When delete is
              being used with --out, the selected entries are deleted from the
              archive  and  all  other  entries are copied to the new archive,
              while copy mode selects the files to include in the new archive.
              Unlike -u update, input patterns on the command line are matched
              against archive entries only and not the file system files.  For
              instance,

                     zip inarchive "*.c" --copy --out outarchive

              copies  entries  with  names ending in .c from inarchive to out-
              archive.  The wildcard must be escaped on some systems  to  pre-
              vent  the  shell  from substituting names of files from the file
              system which can have no relevance to the  entries  in  the  ar-
              chive.

              If  no input files appear on the command line and --out is used,
              copy mode is assumed:

                     zip inarchive --out outarchive

              This is useful for changing split size for instance.  Encrypting
              and  decrypting  entries  is  not yet supported using copy mode.
              Use zipcloak for that.

       -UN v
       --unicode v
              Determine what zip should do with Unicode file names.   zip 3.0,
              in  addition  to  the standard file path, now includes the UTF-8
              translation of the path if the entry path is not entirely  7-bit
              ASCII.   When  an entry is missing the Unicode path, zip reverts
              back to the standard file path.   The  problem  with  using  the
              standard  path is this path is in the local character set of the
              zip that created the entry, which can  contain  characters  that
              are  not  valid  in  the  character set being used by the unzip.
              When zip is reading an archive, if an entry also has  a  Unicode
              path, zip now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate the
              standard path using the current local character set.

              This option can be used to determine what  zip  should  do  with
              this  path  if  there  is a mismatch between the stored standard
              path and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard
              path  was  updated).  In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is
              assumed that the standard path is  more  current  and  zip  uses
              that.  Values for v are:

                     q - quit if paths do not match

                     w - warn, continue with standard path

                     i - ignore, continue with standard path

                     n - no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths

              The default is to warn and continue.

              Characters  that  are not valid in the current character set are
              escaped as #Uxxxx and #Lxxxxxx, where x is  an  ASCII  character
              for a hex digit.  The first is used if a 16-bit character number
              is sufficient to represent the Unicode character and the  second
              if  the character needs more than 16 bits to represent it\'s Uni-
              code character code.  Setting -UN to

                     e - escape

              as in

                     zip archive -sU -UN=e

              forces zip to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit
              ASCII.

              Normally zip stores UTF-8 directly in the standard path field on
              systems where UTF-8 is the current character set and stores  the
              UTF-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.  The option

                     u - UTF-8

              as in

                     zip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8

              forces  zip  to store UTF-8 as native in the archive.  Note that
              storing UTF-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that  sup-
              port  it.   This option could be useful on Windows systems where
              the escaped path is too large to be a valid path and  the  UTF-8
              version of the path is smaller, but native UTF-8 is not backward
              compatible on Windows systems.


       -v
       --verbose
              Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.

              Normally, when applied to real operations, this  option  enables
              the  display of a progress indicator during compression (see -dd
              for more on dots) and requests  verbose  diagnostic  info  about
              zipfile structure oddities.

              However,  when -v is the only command line argument a diagnostic
              screen is printed instead.  This should now work even if  stdout
              is redirected to a file, allowing easy saving of the information
              for sending with bug reports to Info-ZIP.   The  version  screen
              provides  the help screen header with program name, version, and
              release date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP home  and  distribu-
              tion  sites,  and shows information about the target environment
              (compiler type and version, OS version, compilation date and the
              enabled optional features used to create the zip executable).

       -V
       --VMS-portable
              [VMS]  Save VMS file attributes.  (Files are  truncated at EOF.)
              When a -V archive is unpacked on a non-VMS  system,   some  file
              types  (notably  Stream_LF  text  files   and  pure binary files
              like fixed-512) should be extracted intact.  Indexed  files  and
              file  types  with embedded record sizes (notably variable-length
              record types) will probably be seen as corrupt elsewhere.

       -VV
       --VMS-specific
              [VMS] Save VMS file attributes, and  all allocated blocks  in  a
              file,   including  any  data beyond EOF.  Useful for moving ill-
              formed files  among   VMS  systems.    When  a  -VV  archive  is
              unpacked  on a non-VMS system, almost all files will appear cor-
              rupt.

       -w
       --VMS-versions
              [VMS] Append the version  number  of  the  files  to  the  name,
              including  multiple  versions  of files.  Default is to use only
              the most recent version of a specified file.

       -ww
       --VMS-dot-versions
              [VMS] Append the version  number  of  the  files  to  the  name,
              including  multiple  versions  of  files, using the .nnn format.
              Default is to use only the most recent version  of  a  specified
              file.

       -ws
       --wild-stop-dirs
              Wildcards match only at a directory level.  Normally zip handles
              paths as strings and given the paths

                     /foo/bar/dir/file1.c

                     /foo/bar/file2.c

              an input pattern such as

                     /foo/bar/*

              normally would match both paths, the * matching dir/file1.c  and
              file2.c.   Note  that in the first case a directory boundary (/)
              was crossed in the match.  With -ws no directory bounds will  be
              included  in  the  match,  making  wildcards local to a specific
              directory level.  So, with -ws enabled,  only  the  second  path
              would be matched.

              When using -ws, use ** to match across directory boundaries as *
              does normally.

       -x files
       --exclude files
              Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:

                     zip -r foo foo -x \\*.o

              which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while  exclud-
              ing  all  the  files  that  end in .o.  The backslash avoids the
              shell filename substitution, so that the name matching  is  per-
              formed by zip at all directory levels.

              Also possible:

                     zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst

              which  will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while exclud-
              ing  all  the  files  that  match  the  patterns  in  the   file
              exclude.lst.

              The long option forms of the above are

                     zip -r foo foo --exclude \\*.o

              and

                     zip -r foo foo --exclude @exclude.lst

              Multiple patterns can be specified, as in:

                     zip -r foo foo -x \\*.o \\*.c

              If  there is no space between -x and the pattern, just one value
              is assumed (no list):

                     zip -r foo foo -x\\*.o


              See -i for more on include and exclude.

       -X
       --no-extra
              Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on  OS/2,
              uid/gid  and  file  times  on  Unix).  The zip format uses extra
              fields to include additional information for each  entry.   Some
              extra fields are specific to particular systems while others are
              applicable to all systems.  Normally when zip reads entries from
              an  existing archive, it reads the extra fields it knows, strips
              the rest, and adds the extra fields applicable to  that  system.
              With -X, zip strips all old fields and only includes the Unicode
              and Zip64 extra fields (currently these two extra fields  cannot
              be disabled).

              Negating  this  option,  -X-,  includes  all  the  default extra
              fields, but also copies over any unrecognized extra fields.

       -y
       --symlinks
              For UNIX and VMS (V8.3 and later), store symbolic links as  such
              in  the zip archive, instead of compressing and storing the file
              referred to by the link.  This  can  avoid  multiple  copies  of
              files  being  included in the archive as zip recurses the direc-
              tory trees and accesses files directly and by links.

       -z
       --archive-comment
              Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire zip archive.  The
              comment  is  ended by a line containing just a period, or an end
              of file condition (^D on Unix, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS).  The
              comment can be taken from a file:

                     zip -z foo < foowhat

       -Z cm
       --compression-method cm
              Set  the default compression method.  Currently the main methods
              supported by zip are store and deflate.  Compression method  can
              be set to:

              store  -  Setting  the compression method to store forces zip to
              store entries with no compression.   This  is  generally  faster
              than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.  This
              is the same as using -0 (compression level zero).

              deflate - This is the default method for zip.  If zip determines
              that  storing is better than deflation, the entry will be stored
              instead.

              bzip2 - If bzip2 support is compiled in, this compression method
              also  becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently sup-
              port the bzip2 compression method, so test the unzip you will be
              using  before relying on archives using this method (compression
              method 12).

              For example, to add bar.c to archive foo  using  bzip2  compres-
              sion:

                     zip -Z bzip2 foo bar.c

              The compression method can be abbreviated:

                     zip -Zb foo bar.c


       -#
       (-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)
              Regulate  the  speed of compression using the specified digit #,
              where -0 indicates no compression (store all  files),  -1  indi-
              cates  the  fastest  compression speed (less compression) and -9
              indicates the slowest compression  speed  (optimal  compression,
              ignores the suffix list). The default compression level is -6.

              Though  still  being  worked, the intention is this setting will
              control compression speed for  all  compression  methods.   Cur-
              rently only deflation is controlled.

Options
     --all-architectures
             When verifying a code signature on code that has a universal ("fat") Mach-O binary, separately verify each 
             architecture contained. This is the default unless overridden with the -a (--architecture) option.

     -a, --architecture architecture
             When verifying or displaying signatures, explicitly select the Mach-O architecture given. The architecture can be
             specified either by name (e.g. i386) or by number; if by number, a sub-architecture may be appended separated by a comma.
             This option applies only to Mach-O binary code and is ignored for other types.  If the path uses the Mach-O format and
             contains no code of the given architecture, the command will fail.  The default for verification is --all-architec-
             tures, to verify all architectures present.  The default for display is to report on the native architecture of the
             host system.  When signing, codesign will always sign all architectures contained in a universal Mach-O file.

     --bundle-version version-string
             When handling versioned bundles such as frameworks, explicitly specify the version to operate on. This must be one of
             the names in the "Versions" directory of the bundle.  If not specified, codesign uses the bundle\'s default version.
             Note that most frameworks delivered with the system have only one version, and thus this option is irrelevant for them.
             There is currently no facility for operating on all versions of a bundle at once.

     -d, --display
             Display information about the code at the path(s) given. Increasing levels of verbosity produce more output.
             The format is designed to be moderately easy to parse by simple scripts while still making sense to human eyes.  
             In addition, the -r, --file-list, --extract-certificates, and --entitlements options can be used to retrieve
             additional information.

     -D, --detached filename
             When signing, designates that a detached signature should be written to the specified file. The code being signed is
             not modified and need not be writable.  When verifying, designates a file containing a detached signature to be used
             for verification. Any embedded signature in the code is ignored.

     --deep  When signing a bundle, specifies that nested code content such as helpers, frameworks, and plug-ins, should be
             recursively signed in turn. Beware that all signing options you specify will apply, in turn, to such nested content.
             When verifying a bundle, specifies that any nested code content will be recursively verified as to its full content.
             By default, verification of nested content is limited to a shallow investigation that may not detect changes to
             the nested code.
             When displaying a signature, specifies that a list of directly nested code should be written to the display output.
             This lists only code directly nested within the subject; anything nested indirectly will require recursive
             application of the codesign command.

     --detached-database
             When signing, specifies that a detached signature should be generated as with the --detached option, but that the
             resulting signature should be written into a system database, from where it is made automatically available whenever
             apparently unsigned code is validated on the system.
             Writing to this system database requires elevated process privileges that are not available to ordinary users.

     -f, --force
             When signing, causes codesign to replace any existing signature on the path(s) given. Without this option, existing
             signatures will not be replaced, and the signing operation fails.

     -h, --hosting
             Constructs and prints the hosting chain of a running program. The pid arguments must denote running code (pids etc.)
             With verbose options, this also displays the individual dynamic validity status of each element of the hosting chain.

     -i, --identifier identifier
             During signing, explicitly specify the unique identifier string that is embedded in code signatures. If this option is
             omitted, the identifier is derived from either the Info.plist (if present), or the filename of the executable being
             signed, possibly modified by the --prefix option.  It is a very bad idea to sign different programs with the same
             identifier.

     -o, --options flag,...
             During signing, specifies a set of option flags to be embedded in the code signature. The value takes the form of a
             comma-separated list of names (with no spaces). Alternatively, a numeric value can be used to directly specify the
             option mask (CodeDirectory flag word). See OPTION FLAGS below.

     -P, --pagesize pagesize
             Indicates the granularity of code signing. Pagesize must be a power of two.  Chunks of pagesize bytes are separately
             signed and can thus be independently verified as needed.  As a special case, a pagesize of zero indicates that the
             entire code should be signed and verified as a single, possibly gigantic page. This option only applies to the main
             executable and has no effect on the sealing of associated data, including resources.

     -r, --requirements requirements
             During signing, indicates that internal requirements should be embedded in the code path(s) as specified. 
             See "specifying requirements" below.  Defaults will be applied to requirement types that are not explicitly
             specified; if you want to defeat such a default, specify "never" for that type.
             During display, indicates where to write the code\'s internal requirements. Use -r- to write them to standard output.

     -R, --test-requirement requirement
             During verification, indicates that the path(s) given should be verified against the code requirement specified.
             If this option is omitted, the code is verified only for internal integrity and against its own designated requirement.

     -s, --sign identity
             Sign the code at the path(s) given using this identity. See SIGNING IDENTITIES below.

     -v, --verbose
             Sets (with a numeric value) or increments the verbosity level of output. Without the verbose option, no output is
             produced upon success, in the classic UNIX style.  If no other options request a different action, the first -v
             encountered will be interpreted as --verify instead (and does not increase verbosity).

     -v, --verify
             Requests verification of code signatures.  If other actions (sign, display, etc.) are also requested,
             -v is interpreted to mean --verbose.

     --continue
             Instructs codesign to continue processing path arguments even if processing one fails.  If this option is given, exit
             due to operational errors is deferred until all path arguments have been considered. The exit code will then indicate
             the most severe failure (or, with equal severity, the first such failure encountered).

     --dryrun
             During signing, performs almost all signing operations, but does not actually write the result anywhere. Cryptographic
             signatures are still generated, actually using the given signing identity and triggering any access control checks
             normally, though the resulting signature is then discarded.

     --entitlements path
             When signing, take the file at the given path and embed its contents in the signature as entitlement data. If the data
             at path does not already begin with a suitable binary ("blob") header, one is attached automatically.
             When displaying a signature, extract any entitlement data from the signature and write it to the path given. Use "-" to
             write to standard output.  By default, the binary "blob" header is returned intact; prefix the path with a colon ":" to
             automatically strip it off.  If the signature has no entitlement data, nothing is written (this is not an error).

     --extract-certificates prefix
             When displaying a signature, extract the certificates in the embedded certificate chain and write them to individual
             files. The prefix argument is appended with numbers 0, 1, ... to form the filenames, which can be relative or absolute.
             Certificate 0 is the leaf (signing) certificate, and as many files are written as there are certificates in the
             signature. The files are in ASN.1 (DER) form.  If prefix is omitted, the default prefix is "codesign" in the current
             directory.

     --file-list path
             When signing or displaying a signature, codesign writes to the given path a list of files that may have been modified
             as part of the signing process. This is useful for installer or patcher programs that need to know what was changed or
             what files are needed to make up the "signature" of a program. The file given is appended-to, with one line per
             absolute path written. An argument of "-" (single dash) denotes standard output.  Note that the list may be somewhat
             pessimistic - all files not listed are guaranteed to be unchanged by the signing process, but some of the listed files may
             not actually have changed.  Also note that changes may have been made to extended attributes of these files.

     --ignore-resources
             During static validation, do not validate the contents of the code\'s resources.  In effect, this will pass validation
             on code whose resources have been corrupted (or inappropriately signed). On large programs, it will also substantially
             speed up static validation, since all the resources will not be read into memory.  Obviously, the outcome of such a
             validation should be considered on its merits.

     --keychain filename
             During signing, only search for the signing identity in the keychain file specified. This can be used to break any
             matching ties if you have multiple similarly-named identities in several keychains on the user\'s search list.  Note
             that the standard keychain search path is still consulted while constructing the certificate chain being embedded in
             the signature.
             Note that filename will not be searched to resolve the signing identity\'s certificate chain unless it is also on the
             user\'s keychain search list.

     --prefix string
             If no explicit unique identifier is specified (using the -i option), and if the implicitly generated identifier does
             not contain any dot (.) characters, then the given string is prefixed to the identifier before use. If the implicit
             identifier contains a dot, it is used as-is. Typically, this is used to deal with command tools without Info.plists,
             whose default identifier is simply the command\'s filename; the conventional prefix used is com.domain. (note that the
             final dot needs to be explicit).

     --preserve-metadata=list
             When re-signing code that is already signed, reuse some information from the old signature.  If new data is specified
             explicitly, it is preferred.  You still need to specify the -f (--force) option to enable overwriting signatures at
             all.  If this option is absent, any old signature has no effect on the signing process.
             This option takes a comma-separated list of names, which you may reasonably abbreviate:

             identifier    Preserve the signing identifier (--identifier) instead of generating a default identifier.

             entitlements  Preserve the entitlement data (--entitlements).

             requirements  Preserve the internal requirements (--requirements option), including any explicit Designated
                           Requirement. Note that all internal requirements are preserved or regenerated as a whole; you
                           cannot pick and choose individual elements with this option.
             For historical reasons, this option can be given without a value, which preserves all of these values as presently
             known. This use is deprecated and will eventually be removed; always specify an explicit list of preserved items.

     --strict options
             When validating code, apply additional restrictions beyond the defaults.

             symlinks  Check that symbolic links inside the code bundle point to sealed files inside its bundle.  This means that
                       broken symbolic links are rejected, as are links to places outside the bundle and to places that are not,
                       for whatever reason, sealed by the signature.

             sideband  Check that no resource forks, Finder attributes, or similar sideband data is present in the signed code.
                       This is now automatically enforced by signing operations.
             Options can be specified as a comma-separated list. Use plain --strict or --strict=all to be as strict as possible.
             Note that --strict=all may include more checking types over time.
             Not all strictness check make sense in all circumstances, which is why these behaviors are not the defualt.

     --timestamp [=URL]
             During signing, requests that a timestamp authority server be contacted to authenticate the time of signing. The server
             contacted is given by the URL value.  If this option is given without a value, a default server provided by Apple is
             used.  Note that this server may not support signatures made with identities not furnished by Apple.  If the timestamp
             authority service cannot be contacted over the Internet, or it malfunctions or refuses service, the signing operation
             will fail.
             If this option is not given at all, a system-specific default behavior is invoked.  This may result in some but not all
             code signatures being timestamped.
             The special value none explicitly disables the use of timestamp services.', 'bash');

     -k            Create or extract from a PKZip archive instead of the default CPIO.
                   PKZip archives should be stored in filenames ending in .zip.

     --keepParent  When creating an archive, embed the parent directory name src in dst_archive.

     --arch arch   Thin Universal binaries to the specified architecture.
                   If multiple --arch options are specified then the resulting destination file
                   will contain each of the specified architectures (if they are present in the
                   source file).  arch should be specified as "i386", "x86_64", etc.

     --bom bom     Copy only files, links, devices, and directories that are present in the
                   specified BOM.

     --rsrc        Preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data.  ditto will store this data in
                   Carbon-compatible ._ AppleDouble files on filesystems that do not natively 
                   support resource forks.  As of Mac OS X 10.4, --rsrc is default behavior.

     --norsrc      Do not preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data.
                   If both --norsrc and --rsrc are passed, whichever is passed last will take
                   precedence.  Both options override DITTONORSRC.
                   Unless explicitly specified, --norsrc also implies --noextattr and --noacl
                   to match the behavior of Mac OS X 10.4.

     --extattr     Preserve extended attributes (requires --rsrc).
                   As of Mac OS X 10.5, --extattr is the default.

     --noextattr   Do not preserve extended attributes (requires --norsrc).

     --qtn         Preserve quarantine information.  As of Mac OS X 10.5, --qtn is the default.

     --noqtn       Do not preserve quarantine information.

     --acl         Preserve Access Control Lists (ACLs).  As of Mac OS X 10.5, --acl is the default.

     --noacl       Do not preserve ACLs.

     --nocache     Do not perform copies using the Mac OS X Unified Buffer Cache.
                   Files read and written will not be cached, although if the file is
                   already present in the cache, the cached information will be used.

     --hfsCompression
                   When copying files or extracting content from an archive, if the destination is
                   an HFS+ volume that supports compression, all the content will be compressed if
                   appropriate. This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, and is only
                   intended to be used in installation and backup scenarios that involve system files.
                   Since files using HFS+ compression are not readable on versions of Mac OS X earlier
                   than 10.6, this flag should not be used when dealing with non-system files or other
                   user-generated content that will be used on a version of Mac OS X earlier than 10.6.

     --nohfsCompression
                   Do not compress files with HFS+ compression when copying or extracting content
                   from an archive unless the content is already compressed with HFS+ compression.
                   This flag is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.  --nohfsCompression is the default.

     --preserveHFSCompression
                   When copying files to an HFS+ volume that supports compression, ditto will preserve
                   the compression of any source files that were using HFS+ compression.
                   This flag is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.  --preserveHFSCompression is the default.

     --nopreserveHFSCompression
                   Do not preserve HFS+ compression when copying files that are already compressed
                   with HFS+ compression. This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.

     --sequesterRsrc
                   When creating a PKZip archive, preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data in the
                   subdirectory __MACOSX.  PKZip extraction will automatically find these resources.

     --zlibCompressionLevel num
                   Sets the compression level to use when creating a PKZip archive. The compression
                   level can be set from 0 to 9, where 0 represents no compression, and 9 represents
                   optimal (slowest) compression.
                   By default, ditto will use the default compression level as defined by zlib.

     --password    When extracting a password-encrypted ZIP archive, you must specify --password to
                   allow ditto to prompt for a password to use to extract the contents of the file.
                   If this option is not provided, and a password-encrypted file is encountered,
                   ditto will emit an error message.', 'bash');

             The volumes listed are the mounted volumes available when the command is run.

   -pkginfo
             Displays a list of packages that can be installed onto the target volume.  If a metapackage is given as
             the package source, all of its subpackages are listed.

   -query flag
             Queries a package for information about the metadata.  See -help for supported flags.

   -allowUntrusted
             Allow install of a package signed by an untrusted (or expired) certificate.

   -dumplog
             Detailed log information is always sent to syslog using the LOG_INSTALL facility (and will wind up in
             /var/log/install.log).  -dumplog additionally writes this log to standard error output.

   -help     Display the help screen describing the list of parameters.

   -verbose  Display more descriptive information than the default output.
             Use this parameter in conjunction with -pkginfo and  -volinfo information requests to see more readable output.
             The default output is formatted for scripting.

   -verboseR Same information as -verbose except the output is formatted for easy parsing.

   -vers     Display the version of this command.

   -config   Format the command line installation arguments for later use.  The output is sent to stdout, but can be
             redirected to a file to create a configuration file.
             When specifying this option, an installation is not actually performed.  This configuration file can be supplied
             as the argument to the -file parameter instead of typing a long series of installation arguments.
             The config file can be used to perform multiple identical installs.
             Create a config file as follows:
             installer -pkg ~/Documents/Foo.pkg -target / -config > /tmp/configfile.plist

   -plist    Formats the installer output into an XML file, which is sent by default to stdout.
             Use this parameter for -dominfo, -volinfo, and -pkginfo

   -file pathToFile
             The path to the XML file containing parameter information in the key/value dictionary.
             This file can be used instead of the command line parameters, and supersedes any parameters on the
             command line.  When you type this parameter, you type the path to the XML file.
             Use with config file generated by -config For example:
             installer -file /tmp/configfile.plist

   -lang ISOLanguageCode
             Default language of installed system (ISO format).
             This is only necessary when performing a system (OS) install, otherwise is it ignored.
             There is no verification done to make sure that the language being set actually exists on the machine
             however the ISO language code is verified to ensure that it is valid.

   -listiso
             Display the list of valid ISO language codes the installer recognizes.

   -showChoiceChangesXML
             Print to stdout the install choices for the package (specified with -pkg) in an XML format.
             This allows choice attributes to be modified and applied at install-time using
             -applyChoiceChangesXML.  See CHOICE CHANGES FILE for details of this XML format.

   -applyChoiceChangesXML pathToXMLFile
             Applies the install choice changes specified in pathToXMLFile to the default choices in the package
             before installation. This allows the command-line installer to customize choice what gets installed.
             See CHOICE CHANGES FILE for details of this XML format.
             Any problems encountered while applying the choice changes will be reported to the LOG_INSTALL
             facility (i.e. to /var/log/install.log), and also to stdout if -dumplog is used.

   -showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML pathToXMLFile
             Applies the install choice changes specified in pathToXMLFile to the default choices in the package,
             and then dumps the resulting choice state to stdout.
             The input and output XML format is as described in CHOICE CHANGES FILE.  Since changing one choice
             in a package can implicitly change other choices, this option allows you to confirm that a particular
             choiceChanges file will have the intended effect. You must specify a -target when using this option,
             since the evaluated choices can also change with the state of the target disk.

   -showChoicesXML
             Print to stdout the install choices for the package (specified with -pkg) in a hierarchical XML format.
             This is not the same format as used with -applyChoiceChangesXML.
             This option is provided for System Image Utility only.

   -store    Install the product archive specified by -package, in the same way that it would be installed
             through the Mac App Store. In this mode, no other options are supported.
             (You can specify -target, but the only allowable value is the root volume mount point, /). 
             For best Mac App Store fidelity, run installer as an admin user (not using sudo); you will be prompted
             for your admin user\'s password before the install begins.

             This mode is provided for testing a product archive before submission to the Mac App Store.
             See productbuild(1) for how to create a product archive.', 'bash');

Options

    kext     Unload the loaded kext whose bundle identifier matches the
              CFBundleIdentifier of kext.  All instances of IOService sub-
              classes defined by the loaded kext and in the IOService plane of
              the I/O Registry are terminated; the kext is checked to make
              sure no instances of its libkern C++ classes remain; the kext\'s
              C++ static destructores and module stop routine are invoked;
              then the kext\'s executable and IOKitPersonalities are unloaded
              from the kernel.  Failure at any stage prevents kext unload.

     -b identifier, -bundle-id identifier
              Unload executable and IOKitPersonalities (as described immedi-
              ately above) for the kext whose CFBundleIdentifier is
              identifier.

     -c classname, -class classname
              Terminate all instances of class classname that are in the
              IOService plane of the I/O Registry, if possible, but do not
              unload the defining kext or its IOKitPersonalities.  New load
              requests for devices that were driven by these terminated
              instances may result in the same class being instantiated at any
              time.

     -h, -help
              Print a help message describing each option flag and exit with a
              success result, regardless of any other options on the command
              line.

     -m identifier
              Same as -b (remains for backward compatibility).

     -p, -personalities-only
              Terminate services and remove personalities only; do not unload
              kexts.

     -q, -quiet
              Quiet mode; print no informational or error messages.

     -v [0-6 | 0x####], -verbose [0-6 | 0x####]
              Verbose mode; print information about program operation.  Higher
              levels of verbosity include all lower levels.  By default
              kextunload prints only warnings and errors.  You can specify a
              level from 0-6, or a hexadecimal log specification (as described
              in kext_logging(8)). The levels of verbose output are:

              0            Print only errors (that is, suppress warnings); see
                           also -quiet.

              1 (or none)  Print basic information about program operation.

              2            Prints information about unload stages.

              3            Prints information about removal of personalities.

              4            Prints information about module stop functions and
                           C++ class destruction.

              5            Prints detailed information internal operations
                           such as bookkeping.

              6            Identical to level 5 for kextunload.

              Unlike in other kext tools, the -verbose flag in kextunload
              applies to all kexts (that is, it turns on hexadecimal bit 0x8
              by default).  See kext_logging(8) for more information on ver-

SPECIFIERS (Target domain/service)
Many subcommands in launchctl take a specifier which indicates the target
domain or service for the subcommand.

This specifier may take one of the following forms:

     system/[service-name]
              Targets the system domain or a service within the system domain.
              The system domain manages the root Mach bootstrap and is considered a privileged
              execution context. Anyone may read or query the system domain,  but root
              privileges are required to make modifications.
             

     user/uid/[service-name]
              Targets the user domain for the given UID or a service within that domain.
              A user domain may exist independently of a logged-in user.
              User domains do not exist on iOS.

     login/asid/[service-name]
              Targets a user-login domain or service within that domain. A user-login domain
              is created when the user logs in at the GUI and is identified by the audit
              session identifier associated with that login.
              If a user domain has an associated login domain, the print subcommand will
              display the ASID of that login domain. User-login domains do not exist on iOS.

     gui/uid/[service-name]
              Another form of the login specifier. Rather than specifying a user-login
              domain by its ASID, this specifier targets the domain based on which user
              it is associated with and is generally more convenient.

              To discover a user’s UID, run the command: id -u username
              where username is the full user account name.

              Note: GUI domains and user domains share many resources. For the purposes of
              the Mach bootstrap name lookups, they are "flat", so they share the
              same set of registered names. But they still have discrete sets of services.
              So when printing the user domain\'s contents, you may see many Mach bootstrap
              name registrations from services that exist in the GUI domain for that user,
              but you will not see the services themselves in that list.

     session/asid/[service-name]
              Targets the session domain for the given audit session ID or a service within
              that domain. For more information about audit sessions, see auditon(2) and libbsm(3)

     pid/pid/[service-name]
              Targets the domain for the given PID or a service within that domain.
              Each process on the system will have a PID domain associated with it that consists of
              the XPC services visible to that  process which can be reached with xpc_connection_create(3).

SUBCOMMANDS

     bootstrap domain-target [service-path service-path2 ...] | service-target

              Bootstrap a domain/service (equivalent to Load in the legacy syntax).
              Services may be specified as a series of paths or a service identifier.

              Paths may point to XPC service bundles, launchd.plist(5) s, or a directory(s)
              containing a collection of either.
              If there were one or more errors while bootstrapping or removing a collection of
              services, the problematic paths will be printed with the errors that occurred.

              If no paths or service target are specified, this commands will bootstrap a domain
              specified as a domain target.
              Some domains will implicitly bootstrap pre-defined paths as part of their creation.

     bootout domain-target [service-path service-path2 ...] | service-target

              Remove domain/service (equivalent to unload in the legacy syntax).
              Services may be specified as a series of paths or a service identifier.

              Paths may point to XPC service bundles, launchd.plist(5) s, or a directory(s) containing
              a collection of either.
              If there were one or more errors while bootstrapping or removing a collection of
              services, the problematic paths will be printed with the errors that occurred.

              If no paths or service target are specified, this commands willremove a domain
              specified as a domain target.

     enable service-target
              Enable the service in the requested domain. This subcommand may only
              target services within the system domain or user and user-login domains.

     disable service-target
              Disable the service in the requested domain. Once a service is disabled, it cannot
              be loaded in the specified domain until it is once again enabled.
              This state persists across boots of the device.
              This subcommand may only target services within the system domain or user and user-login domains.

     uncache service-name
              This subcommand instructs launchd to bypass its service cache for the named service
              and instead read the service\'s configuration file directly from disk.
              launchd maintains an in-memory cache of XPC service configuration files to minimize
              the disk I/O. This subcommand will remove a cached entry so that developers may more
              rapidly iterate on a service\'s configuration.
              It should not ever be used as part of production workflow.

     kickstart [-kp] service-target
              Instructs launchd to kickstart the specified service.

              -k       If the service is already running, kill the running
                       instance before restarting the service.

              -p       Upon success, print the PID of the new process or the
                       already-running process to stdout.

     attach [-ksx] service-target
              Attaches the system\'s debugger to the process currently backing the specified service.
              By default, if the service is not running, this subcommand will block until the service starts.

              -k       If the service is already running, kill the running instance.

              -s       Force the service to start.

              -x       Attach to xpcproxy(3) before it execs and becomes the service process.
                       This flag is generally not useful for anyone but the launchd maintainer.

     debug service-target [--program program path] [--guard-malloc]
              [--malloc-stack-logging] [--debug-libraries]
              [--introspection-libraries] [--NSZombie] [--32] [--stdin]
              [--stdout] [--stderr] [--environment] [--] [argv0 argv1 argv2
              ...]
              Configures the next invocation of a service for debugging. This subcommand allows
              you to temporarily replace the main executable  of the service with one at
              a different path, enable libgmalloc(3), set environment variables, set the argument
              vector and more.
              This is a convenient alternative to editing the launchd.plist(5) for the service and
              then reloading it, as the additional debugging properties are cleared once the service has
              run once with them.

              --program program-path
                       Instructs launchd(8) to use program-path as the  service\'s executable.

              --guard-malloc
                       Turns on libgmalloc(3) for the service.

              --malloc-stack-logging
                       Turns on malloc(3) stack logging for the service.

              --malloc-nano-allocator
                       Turns on the malloc(3) nano allocator for the service.

              --debug-libraries
                       Sets the DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX for the service to "_debug",  which prefers the debug variants
                       of libraries if they exist. See dyld(1) for more information.

              --introspection-libraries
                       Adds /usr/lib/system/introspection to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
                       for the service. This causes the system to prefer the introspection
                       variants of libraries if they exist.

              --NSZombie
                       Enables NSZombie.

              --32     Runs the service in the appropriate 32-bit architecture.
                       Only available on 64-bit platforms.

              --stdin [stdin-path]
                       Sets the service\'s standard input to be stdin-path.  If no file is given,
                       uses the current terminal as the service\'s standard input.
                       If stdin-path does not exist, it is created.

              --stdout [stdout-path]
                       Sets the service\'s standard input to be stdout-path.
                       If no file is given, uses the current terminal as the service\'s standard input.
                       If stdout-path does not exist, it is created.

              --stderr [stderr-path]
                       Sets the service\'s standard input to be stderr-path.
                       If no file is given, uses the current terminal as the service\'s standard input.
                       If stderr-path does not exist, it is created.

              --environment VARIABLE0=value VARIABLE1=value ...
                       Set the given environment variables on the service.

              -- argv0 argv1 ...
                       Any arguments following the -- are given to the service
                       as its argument vector.

                       IMPORTANT: These arguments replace the service\'s
                       default argument vector; they are not merged in any
                       way. The first argument following -- is given as the
                       initial (zeroth) element of the service\'s argument vec-
                       tor. As with the ProgramArguments launchd.plist(5) key,
                       you should read carefully and understand the execve(2)
                       man page.

     kill signal-name | signal-number service-target
              Sends the specified signal to the specified service if it is running.
              The signal number or name (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, etc.) may be specified.

     blame service-target
              If the service is running, prints a human-readable string describing why launchd
              launched the service. Note that services may run for many reasons; this subcommand
              will only show the most proximate reason. So if a service was run due to a timer
              firing, this subcommand will print that reason, irrespective of  whether there
              were messages waiting on the service\'s various  endpoints.
              This subcommand is only intended for debugging and profiling use and its
              output should not be relied upon in production scenarios.

     print domain-target | service-target
              Prints information about the specified service or domain. Domain output
              includes various properties about the domain as well as a list of services
              and endpoints in the domain with state pertaining to each.
              Service output includes various properties of the service, including
              information about its origin on-disk, its current state,
              execution context, and last exit status.

              IMPORTANT: This output is NOT API in any sense at all. Do NOT
              rely on the structure or information emitted for ANY reason. It
              may change from release to release without warning.

     print-cache
              Prints the contents of the launchd service cache.

     print-disabled
              Prints the list of disabled services.

     plist [segment,section] Mach-O
              Prints the the property list embedded in the __TEXT,__info_plist
              segment/section of the target Mach-O or the specified seg-
              ment/section.

     procinfo pid
              Prints information about the execution context of the specified
              PID. This information includes Mach task-special ports and
              exception ports (and when run against a DEVELOPMENT launchd,
              what names the ports are advertised as in the Mach bootstrap
              namespace, if they are known to launchd) and audit session context.
              This subcommand is intended for diagnostic purposes only,
              and its output should not be relied upon in production scenarios.
              This command requires root privileges.

     hostinfo
              Prints information about the system\'s host-special ports,
              including the host-exception port. This subcommand requires root privileges.

     resolveport owner-pid port-name
              Given a PID and the name of a Mach port right in that process\' port namespace,
              resolves that port to an endpoint name known to launchd.
              This subcommand requires root privileges.

     examine [tool arg0 arg1 @PID ...]
              Causes launchd to fork(2) itself for examination by a profiling tool and 
              prints the PID of this new instance to stdout. You are responsible for killing
              this snapshot when it is no longer needed.

              Many profiling tools cannot safely examine launchd because they depend on the
              functionality it provides. This subcommand creates an effective snapshot
              of launchd that can be examined independently.
              Note that on Darwin platforms, fork(2) is implemented such that only
              the thread which called fork(2) is replicated into the new child
              process, so this subcommand is not useful for  examining any thread
              other than the main event loop.

              This subcommand takes an optional invocation of a tool to be  used on the
              launchd snapshot. Where you would normally give the PID of the process
              to be examined in the tool\'s invocation, instead specify the argument
              "@PID", and launchctl will substi  tute that argument with the PID
              of the launchd snapshot in its subsequent execution of the tool.
              If used in this form, launchctl will automatically kill the snapshot
              instance when the examination tool exits.

              This subcommand may only be used against a DEVELOPMENT launchd.

     config system | user parameter value
              Sets persistent configuration information for launchd(8)
              domains. Only the system domain and user domains may be configured.
              The location of the persistent storage is an implementation detail,
              and changes to that storage should only be made through this subcommand.
              A reboot is required for changes made through this subcommand to take effect.

              Supported configuration parameters are:

              umask    Sets the umask(2) for services within the target domain
                       to the value specified by value.  Note that this value
                       is parsed by strtoul(3) as an octal-encoded number, so
                       there is no need to prefix it with a leading \'0\'.

              path     Sets the PATH environment variable for all services
                       within the target domain to the string value.  The
                       string value should conform to the format outlined for
                       the PATH environment variable in environ(7).  Note that
                       if a service specifies its own PATH, the service-spe-
                       cific environment variable will take precedence.

                       NOTE: This facility cannot be used to set general envi-
                       ronment variables for all services within the domain.
                       It is intentionally scoped to the PATH environment
                       variable and nothing else for security reasons.

     reboot [system|userspace|halt|logout|apps|reroot mount-point]
              Instructs launchd to begin tearing down userspace. With no argument
              given or with the system argument given, launchd will make
              the reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely
              torn down. With the halt argument given, launchd will make the
              reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely torn
              down and pass the RB_HALT flag, halting the system and not initiating
              a reboot.

              With the userspace argument given, launchd will re-exec itself
              when userspace has been torn down and bring userspace back up.
              This is useful for rebooting the system quickly under conditions
              where kernel data structures or hardware do not need to be reinitialized.

              With the reroot argument given, launchd will perform a userspace
              shutdown as with the userspace argument, but it will exec a copy
              of launchd from the specified mount-point.  This mechanism is a
              light-weight way of changing boot partitions. As part of this
              process, launchd will make mount-point the new root partition
              and bring userspace up as if the kernel had designated
              mount-point as the root partition.

              IMPORTANT: This type of reboot will, in no way, affect the
              already-running kernel on the host. Therefore, when using this
              option to switch to another volume, you should only target vol-
              umes whose userspace stacks are compatible with the already-run-
              ning kernel.

              NOTE: As of the date of this writing, this option does not com-
              pletely work.

              With the logout argument given, launchd will tear down the
              caller\'s GUI login session in a manner similar to a logout ini-
              tiated from the Apple menu. The key difference is that a logout
              initiated through this subcommand will be much faster since it
              will not give apps a chance to display modal dialogs to block
              logout indefinitely; therefore there is data corruption risk to
              using this option. Only use it when you know you have no unsaved
              data in your running apps.

              With the apps argument given, launchd will terminate all apps
              running in the caller\'s GUI login session that did not come from
              a launchd.plist(5) on-disk. Apps like Finder, Dock and Syste-
              mUIServer will be unaffected. Apps are terminated in the same
              manner as the logout argument, and all the same caveats apply.

              -s       When rebooting the machine (either a full reboot or
                       userspace reboot), brings the subsequent boot session
                       up in single-user mode.

     error [posix|mach|bootstrap] code
              Prints a human-readable string of the given error code.  By
              default, launchctl will attempt to guess which error domain the
              code given belongs to. The caller may optionally specify which
              domain (either posix, mach, or bootstrap) to interpret the given
              code as an error from that subsystem.

     variant  Prints the launchd variant currently active on the system. Pos-
              sible variants include RELEASE, DEVELOPMENT and DEBUG.

     version  Prints the launchd version string.

MORE SUBCOMMANDS

     Subcommands from the previous implementation of launchd are generally
     available, though some may be unimplemented. Unimplemented subcommands
     are documented as such.

     load | unload [-wF] [-S sessiontype] [-D searchpath] paths ...
              Load the specified configuration files or directories of
              configuration files.  Jobs that are not on-demand will be started
              as soon as possible. All specified jobs will be loaded before any
              of them are allowed to start. Note that per-user configuration
              files (LaunchAgents) must be owned by root (if they are located
              in /Library/LaunchAgents) or the user loading them (if they are
              located in $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents).  All system-wide daemons
              (LaunchDaemons) must be owned by root. Configuration files must
              disallow group and world writes. These restrictions are in place
              for security reasons, as allowing writability to a launchd
              configuration file allows one to specify which executable will be
              launched.

              Note that allowing non-root write access to the
              /System/Library/LaunchDaemons directory WILL render your system
              unbootable.

              -w       Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false or true
                       for the load and unload subcommands respectively.
                       In previous versions, this option would modify the configuration file.
                       Now the state of the Disabled key is stored elsewhere on- disk
                       in a location that may not be directly manipulated by any
                       process other than launchd.

              -F       Force the loading or unloading of the plist. Ignore the Disabled key.

              -S sessiontype
                       Some jobs only make sense in certain contexts. This
                       flag instructs launchctl to look for jobs in a differ-
                       ent location when using the -D flag, and allows
                       launchctl to restrict which jobs are loaded into which
                       session types. Sessions are only relevant for per-user
                       launchd contexts. Relevant sessions are Aqua (the
                       default), Background and LoginWindow.  Background
                       agents may be loaded independently of a GUI login. Aqua
                       agents are loaded only when a user has logged in at the
                       GUI. LoginWindow agents are loaded when the LoginWindow
                       UI is displaying and currently run as root.

              -D searchpath
                       Load or unload all plist(5) files in the search path  given.
                       This option may be thought of as expanding into many
                       individual paths depending on the search path given.
                       Valid search paths include "system," "local,"  and "all."
                       When providing a session type, an additional search path
                       is available for use called "user." For example, 
                       without a session type given, "-D system" would load from
                       or unload all property list files from
                       /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.  With a session type
                       passed, it would load from
                       /System/Library/LaunchAgents.  Note that launchctl no
                       longer respects the network search path.

                       In a previous version of launchd, these search paths
                       were called "domains", hence -D. The word "domain" is
                       now used for a totally different concept.

              NOTE: Due to bugs in the previous implementation and long-stand-
              ing client expectations around those bugs, the load and unload
              subcommands will only return a non-zero exit code due to
              improper usage.  Otherwise, zero is always returned.

     submit -l label [-p executable] [-o stdout-path] [-e stderr-path] --
              command [arg0] [arg1] [...]
              A simple way of submitting a program to run without a configuration
              file. This mechanism also tells launchd to keep the program alive in the event
              of failure.

              -l label
                       What unique label to assign this job to launchd.

              -p program
                       What program to really execute, regardless of what follows
                       the -- in the submit sub-command.

              -o stdout-path
                       Where to send the stdout of the program.

              -e stderr-path
                       Where to send the stderr of the program.

     remove label
              Remove the job from launchd by label. This subcommand will
              return immediately and not block until the job has been stopped.

     start label
              Start the specified job by label. The expected use of this sub-
              command is for debugging and testing so that one can manually
              kick-start an on-demand server.

     stop label
              Stop the specified job by label. If a job is on-demand, launchd
              may immediately restart the job if launchd finds any criteria
              that is satisfied.

     list [-x] [label]
              With no arguments, list all of the jobs loaded into launchd in
              three columns. The first column displays the PID of the job if
              it is running.  The second column displays the last exit status
              of the job. If the number in this column is negative, it repre-
              sents the negative of the signal which stopped the job. Thus,
              "-15" would indicate that the job was terminated with SIGTERM.
              The third column is the job\'s label. If [label] is specified,
              prints information about the requested job.

              -x       This flag is no longer supported.

     setenv key value
              Specify an environment variable to be set on all future pro-
              cesses launched by launchd in the caller\'s context.

     unsetenv key
              Specify that an environment variable no longer be set on any
              future processes launched by launchd in the caller\'s context.

     getenv key
              Print the value of an environment variable that launchd would
              set for all processes launched into the caller\'s context.

     export   Export all of the environment variables of launchd for use in a
              shell eval statement.

     getrusage self | children
              Get the resource utilization statistics for launchd or the children
              of launchd.  This subcommand is not implemented.

     log [level loglevel] [only | mask loglevels...]
              Get and set the syslog(3) log level mask. The available log levels
              are: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert
              and emergency. This subcommand is not implemented.

     limit [cpu | filesize | data | stack | core | rss | memlock | maxproc |
              maxfiles] [both [soft | hard]]
              With no arguments, this command prints all the resource limits
              of launchd as found via getrlimit(2).  When a given resource is
              specified, it prints the limits for that resource. With a third
              argument, it sets both the hard and soft limits to that value.
              With four arguments, the third and forth argument represent the
              soft and hard limits respectively.  See setrlimit(2).

     shutdown
              Tell launchd to prepare for shutdown by removing all jobs. This
              subcommand is not implemented.

     umask [newmask]
              Get or optionally set the umask(2) of launchd.  This subcommand
              is not implemented.

     bslist [PID | ..] [-j]
              This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the print subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     bsexec PID command [args]
              This executes the given command in as similar an execution con-
              text as possible to the target PID. Adopted attributes include
              the Mach bootstrap namespace, exception server and security
              audit session. It does not modify the process\' credentials (UID,
              GID, etc.) or adopt any environment variables from the target
              process. It affects only the Mach bootstrap context and
              directly-related attributes.

     asuser UID command [args]
              This executes the given command in as similar an execution con-
              text as possible to that of the target user\'s bootstrap. Adopted
              attributes include the Mach bootstrap namespace, exception
              server and security audit session. It does not modify the
              process\' credentials (UID, GID, etc.) or adopt any user-specific
              environment variables. It affects only the Mach bootstrap con-
              text and directly- related attributes.

     bstree   This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the print subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     managerpid
              This prints the PID of the launchd which manages the current
              bootstrap. In prior implementations, there could be multiple
              launchd processes each managing their own Mach bootstrap sub-
              sets. In the current implementation, all bootstraps are managed
              by one process, so this subcommand will always print "1".

     manageruid
              This prints the UID associated with the caller\'s launchd con-
              text.

     managername
              This prints the name of the launchd job manager which manages
              the current launchd context. See LimitLoadToSessionType in
              launchd.plist(5) for more details.

          Set the segment alignment of the specified arch_type when creating a universal file 
          containing that  architecture.   value is a hexadecimal number that must be an 
          integral power of 2.  This is only needed when lipo can\'t figure out the alignment 
          of an input  file  (currently  not  an object  file),  or when it guesses at the
          alignment too conservatively.  The default for files unknown to lipo is 0
          (2^0, or an alignment of one byte), and the  default  alignment  for  archives 
          is 4 (2^2, or 4-byte alignment).

     -h     If the NewLinkFile (or directory) is a symbolic link, do not follow

Options
   -f   The -f option is used when a user name is specified to indicate

        UTC (not local) time. Use a value of resume with the -i option to resume a held job.  Use a value of restart
        with the -i option to restart a completed job.

        Specifies which pages to print in the document. The list can contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#)
        separated by commas, e.g., "1,3-5,16". The page numbers refer to the output pages and not the document\'s

              different name if it already has one; or use backup files or spell checking.  Also  accessible
              by invoking nano with any name beginning with \'r\' (e.g. "rnano").

       -S (--smooth)
              Enable  smooth  scrolling.  Text will scroll line-by-line, instead of the usual chunk-by-chunk
              behavior.

       -T cols (--tabsize=cols)
              Set the size (width) of a tab to cols columns.  The value of cols must be greater than 0.  The
              default value is 8.

       -U (--quickblank)
              Do  quick  statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after 1 keystroke instead of
              25.  Note that -c overrides this.

       -V (--version)
              Show the current version number and exit.

       -W (--wordbounds)
              Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation characters as part of a word.

       -Y str (--syntax=str)
              Specify a specific syntax highlighting from the nanorc to use, if available.

       -c (--const)
              Constantly show the cursor position.  Note that this overrides -U.

       -d (--rebinddelete)
              Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and  Delete  work  properly.   You
              should only need to use this option if Backspace acts like Delete on your system.

       -h (--help)
              Show a summary of command line options and exit.

       -i (--autoindent)
              Indent new lines to the previous line\'s indentation.  Useful when editing source code.

       -k (--cut)
              Enable cut from cursor to end of line.

       -l (--nofollow)
              If  the file being edited is a symbolic link, replace the link with a new file instead of fol-lowing following
              lowing it.  Good for editing files in /tmp, perhaps?

       -m (--mouse)
              Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to
              place  the  cursor, set the mark (with a double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will
              work in the X Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.

       -o dir (--operatingdir=dir)
              Set operating directory.  Makes nano set up something similar to a chroot.

       -p (--preserve)
              Preserve the XON and XOFF sequences (^Q and ^S) so they will be caught by the terminal.

       -r cols (--fill=cols)
              Wrap lines at column cols.  If this value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur at  the  width  of
              the  screen  less  cols  columns,  allowing the wrap point to vary along with the width of the
              screen if the screen is resized.  The default value is -8.

       -s prog (--speller=prog)
              Enable alternative spell checker command.

       -t (--tempfile)
              Always save changed buffer without prompting.  Same as Pico\'s -t option.

       -v (--view)
              View file (read only) mode.

       -w (--nowrap)
              Disable wrapping of long lines.

       -x (--nohelp)
              Disable help screen at bottom of editor.

       -z (--suspend)
              Enable suspend ability.

      net {ads|rap|rpc} options...

Options
       The first argument should be used to  specify the  protocol to use
       when executing a certain command. ADS is used for ActiveDirectory,
       RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and  RPC can be used for NT4
       and above. If this argument is omitted, net will  try to determine
       it automatically. Not all commands are available on all protocols.

  -h|--help
        Print a summary of command line options.

       -w target-workgroup
        Sets target workgroup or domain. You have to specify either this
        option or the IP address or the name of a server.

       -W workgroup
        Sets client workgroup or domain

       -U user
        User name to use

       -I ip-address
        IP address of target server to use. You have to  specify  either
        this option or a target workgroup or a target server.

       -p port
        Port  on  the  target server to connect to (usually 139 or 445).
        Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139.

       -n primary netbios name
        This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name  that   Samba
        uses  for   itself. This is identical to setting the netbios name
        parameter in the smb.conf file. However, a command line  setting
        will take precedence over settings in smb.conf.

       -s configuration file
        The  file   specified contains the configuration details required
        by the server. The information in this file includes server-spe-
        cific  information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
        descriptions of all the services that the server is to  provide.
        See  smb.conf  for  more  information. The default configuration
        file name is determined at compile time.

       -S server
        Name of target server. You should specify either this option  or
        a target workgroup or a target IP address.

       -l     When listing data, give more information on each item.

       -P     Make queries to the external server using the machine account of
        the local server.

       -d|--debug=debuglevel
        debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
        parameter is not specified is zero.

        The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
        files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only crit-
        ical  errors  and   serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a
        reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates  a   small
        amount of information about operations carried out.

        Levels  above  1 will generate considerable amounts of log data,
        and should only be used when  investigating  a  problem.  Levels
        above  3  are  designed  for use only by developers and generate
        HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

        Note that specifying this parameter here will override  the  log
        level parameter in the smb.conf file.', 'bash');

PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
       Several commands accept password arguments, typically using -passin and -passout for
       input and output passwords respectively. These allow the password to be obtained from a
       variety of sources. Both of these options take a single argument whose format is
       described below. If no password argument is given and a password is required then the
       user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the current terminal
       with echoing turned off.

       pass:password
                 the actual password is password. Since the password is visible to utilities
                 (like \'ps\' under Unix) this form should only be used where security is not
                 important.

       env:var   obtain the password from the environment variable var. Since the environment
                 of other processes is visible on certain platforms (e.g. ps under certain
                 Unix OSes) this option should be used with caution.

       file:pathname
                 the first line of pathname is the password. If the same pathname argument is
                 supplied to -passin and -passout arguments then the first line will be used
                 for the input password and the next line for the output password. pathname
                 need not refer to a regular file: it could for example refer to a device or
                 named pipe.

       fd:number read the password from the file descriptor number. This can be used to send
                 the data via a pipe for example.

       stdin     read the password from standard input.', 'bash');

   -l language
         Override the language for any plain text files.
         Normally, plain text files are compiled as AppleScript.

   -e command
         Enter one line of a script.  Script commands given via -e are prepended
         to the normal source, if any.  Multiple -e commands can be given to build
         up a multi-line script.
         Because most scripts use characters that are special to many shell programs
         (e.g., Apple-Script uses single and double quote marks, (, ), and *),
         the command will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell intact.

   -o name
         Place the output in the file name.
         If -o is not specified, the resulting script is placed in the file \'a.scpt\'.

   -d    Place the resulting script in the data fork of the output file.

   -r type:id
         Place the resulting script in the resource fork of the output file, in the
         specified resource.

   -t type
         Set the output file type to type.  Type is a four-character code.
         If this option is omitted and the output file does not exist, the
         type is set to \'osas\', that is, a compiled script.

   -c creator
         Set the output file creator to creator.  Creator is a four-charac-
         ter code.  If this option is omitted and the output file does not
         exist, the creator is set to \'ToyS\', that is, Script Editor.

   -a arch
         Create the applet or droplet for the specified target architecture
         arch.  The allowable values are \'i386\' and \'ppc\'.  By default,

      Because most scripts use characters that are special to many shell programs
      (e.g., Apple-Script uses single and double quote marks, (, ), and *), the command
      will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell intact.

   -i
      Interactive mode: osascript will prompt for one line at a time, and output the result, if applicable,
      after each line. Any script supplied as a command argument using -e or programfile will be loaded,
      but not executed, before starting the interactive prompt. 

   -l language
      Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain text files are compiled as AppleScript.

   -s flags
     Modify the output style.  The flags argument is a string consisting of any of the
     modifier characters e, h, o, and s. 
     Multiple modifiers can be concatenated in the same string, and multiple -s options can be specified.

     The modifiers come in exclusive pairs;
     if conflicting modifiers are specified, the last one takes precedence.
     The meanings of the modifier characters are as follows:

        h  Print values in human-readable form (default).
        s  Print values in recompilable source form.

     osascript normally prints its results in human-readable form:
     strings do not have quotes around them, characters are not escaped,
     braces for lists and records are omitted, etc.  This is generally more useful, but can
     introduce ambiguities.  For example, the lists \'{"foo", "bar"}\' and \'{{"foo", {"bar"}}}\' would
     both be displayed as \'foo, bar\'.  

     To see the results in an unambiguous form that could be recompiled into the same value, use
     the s modifier:

      Transient Connection  The specified nodename/address can be reached
                            via a transient (e.g. PPP) connection.

                            with a network interface on the system.

      Directly Reachable Addresss
                            Network traffic to the specified node-

                            the system.

      The reachability can also be monitored by specifying the -W (watch)
      option.  This will result in the current status being reported as
      well as the status when/if the network configuration changes.

      A zero exit status will be returned when the reachability status is
      reported correctly.  A non-zero exit status will be returned if
      errors are detected with an error reported to standard error.

   -w dynamic-store-key [-t timeout]
      Check if the specified key exists in the "dynamic store" data main-

   --get pref
      Retrieves the specified preference.  The current value will be
      reported on standard output.

      Supported preferences include:

            ComputerName   The user-friendly name for the system.

            LocalHostName  The local (Bonjour) host name.

Key
   -F      As in ls(1), display a slash (`/\') immediately after each path-name that is a directory,
           an asterisk (`*\') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@\') after each symbolic link,
           a percent sign (`%\') after each whiteout, an equal sign (`=\') after each socket, and a vertical
           bar (`|\') after each that is a FIFO.  The use of -F implies -l.

   -f format  Display information using the specified format.
              See the FORMATS section for a description of valid formats.

   -L      Use stat(2) instead of lstat(2).  The information reported by stat will refer to the target of file,
           if file is a symbolic link, and not to file itself.

   -l      Display output in ls -lT format.
   -n      Do not force a newline to appear at the end of each piece of output.
   -q      Suppress failure messages if calls to stat(2) or lstat(2) fail.
           When run as readlink, error messages are automatically suppressed.

   -r      Display raw information.  That is, for all the fields in the stat structure,
           display the raw, numerical value (for example, times in seconds since the epoch, etc.).

   -s      Display information in \'shell output\', suitable for initializing variables.

   -t timefmt  Display timestamps using the specified format.  This format is passed directly to strftime(3).

   -x      Display information in a more verbose way as known from some Linux distributions.

 Formats      Format strings are similar to printf(3) formats in that they start with %,
              are then followed by a sequence of formatting characters, and end in acharacter
              that selects the field of the struct stat which is to be formatted.
              If the % is immediately followed by one of n, t, %, or @, then a newline character,
              a tab character, a percent character, or the current file number is printed,
              otherwise the string is examined for the following:
              Any of the following optional flags:
              #    Selects an alternate output form for octal and hexadecimal output.
                   Non-zero octal output will have a leading zero, and non-zero hexadecimal
                   output will have \'0x\' prepended to it.
              +    Asserts that a sign indicating whether a number is positive or negative
                   should always be printed.  Non-negative numbers are not usually printed with
                   a sign.
              -    Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the right.
              0    Sets the fill character for left padding to the `0\' character, instead of a space.
              space   Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output fields.
                      A \'+\' overrides a space if both are used.

              Then the following fields:
              size    An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field width.
              prec    An optional precision composed of a decimal point \'.\' and a decimal digit
                      string that indicates the maximum string length, the number of digits to
                      appear after the decimal point in floating point output, or the minimum
                      number of digits to appear in numeric output.
              fmt     An optional output format specifier which is one of D, O, U, X, F, or S.
                      These represent signed decimal output, octal output, unsigned decimal output,
                      hexadecimal output, floating point output, and string output, respectively.
                      Some output formats do not apply to all fields.  Floating point output only
                      applies to timespec fields (the a, m, and c fields).
                      The special output specifier S may be used to indicate that the output,
                      if applicable, should be in string format.

                      May be used in combination with:
                      amc     Display date in strftime(3) format.
                      dr      Display actual device name.
                      gu      Display group or user name.
                      p       Display the mode of file as in ls -lTd.
                      N       Displays the name of file.
                      T       Displays the type of file.
                      Y       Insert a \' -> \' into the output.  Note that the default output
                              format for Y is a string, but if specified explicitly,
                              these four characters are prepended.
              sub     An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, low).
                      Only applies to the p, d, r, and T output formats.  It can be one of
                      the following:
                      H       \'High\' -- specifies the major number for devices from r or d,
                              the \'user\' bits for permissions from the string form of p, the file \'type\'
                              bits from the numeric forms of p, and the long output form of T.
                      L       \'Low\' -- specifies the minor number for devices from r or d, the \'other\'
                              bits for permissions from the string form of p, the \'user\', \'group\',
                              and \'other\' bits from the numeric forms of p, and the ls -F style output
                              character for file type when used with T (the use of L for this is optional).
                      M       \'Middle\' -- specifies the \'group\' bits for permissions from the string
                              output form of p, or the \'suid\',\'sgid\', and \'sticky\' bits for the
                              numeric forms of p.
              datum   A required field specifier, being one of the following:
                      d       Device upon which file resides.
                      i       file\'s inode number.
                      p       File type and permissions.
                      l       Number of hard links to file.
                      u, g    User ID and group ID of file\'s owner.
                      r       Device number for character and block device special files.
                      a, m, c, B   The time file was last accessed or modified, of when the inode was last
                              changed, or the birth time of the inode.
                      z       The size of file in bytes.
                      b       Number of blocks allocated for file.
                      k       Optimal file system I/O operation block size.
                      f       User defined flags for file.
                      v       Inode generation number.

                      The following four field specifiers are not drawn directly from the data in struct stat,
                      but are:      N   The name of the file.
                                    T   The file type, either as in ls -F or in a more descriptive form if
                                        the sub field specifier H is given.
                                    Y   The target of a symbolic link.
                                    Z   Expands to \'major,minor\' from the rdev field for character or block
                                        special devices and gives size output for all others.

               Only the % and the field specifier are required. Most field specifiers default to U as an
               output form, with the exception of p which defaults to O, a, m, and c which default to
               D, and Y, T, and N which default to S.

       sudo -V | -h | -l | -L | -v | -k | -K | -s command

Options
   -a  The -a (authentication type) option causes sudo to use the specified
       authentication type when validating the user, as allowed by
        /etc/login.conf.  The system administrator may specify a list of sudo-specific
       authentication methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry in /etc/login.conf.
       This option is only available on systems that support BSD authentication
       where sudo has been configured with the --with-bsdauth option.

   -b  The -b (background) option tells sudo to run the given command in the
       background.  Note that if you use the -b option you cannot use shell job control
       to manipulate the process.

   -c  The -c (class) option causes sudo to run the specified command with resources
       limited by the specified login class.  The class argument can be either 
       a class name as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single \'-\' character.
       Specifying a class of - indicates that the command should be run
       restricted by the default login capabilities for the user the command
       is run as.  If the class argument specifies an existing user class,
       the command must be run as root, or the sudo command must be run from 
       a shell that is already root.  This option is only available on systems
       with BSD login classes where sudo has been configured with the --with-logincap option.

   -h  The -h (help) option causes sudo to print a usage message and exit.

   -H  The -H (HOME) option sets the HOME environment variable to the homedir
       of the target user (root by default) as specified in
       passwd(5).  By default, sudo does not modify HOME.

   -k  The -k (kill) option to sudo invalidates the user\'s timestamp by setting the
       time on it to the epoch.   The next time sudo is run a password will
       be required.  This option does not require a password and was added to
       allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file.

   -K  The -K (sure kill) option to sudo removes the user\'s timestamp
       entirely.  Likewise, this option does not require a password.

   -l  The -l (list) option will list out the allowed (and forbidden) commands
       for the user on the current host.

   -L  The -L (list defaults) option will list out the parameters that may
       be set in a Defaults line along with a short description for each.
       This option is useful in conjunction with grep(1).

   -p  The -p (prompt) option allows you to override the default password
       prompt and use a custom one.   If the password prompt contains the
       %u escape, %u will be replaced with the user\'s login name.
       Similarly, %h will be replaced with the local hostname.

   -P  The -P (preserve group vector) option causes sudo to preserve the
       user\'s group vector unaltered.  By default, sudo will initialize
       the group vector to the list of groups the target user is in.  The
       real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the
       target user.

   -s  The -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment
       variable if it is set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).

   -S  The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from standard
       input instead of the terminal device.

   -u  The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified command as a
       user other than root.  To specify a uid instead of a username, use #uid.

   -v  If given the -v (validate) option, sudo will update the user\'s
       timestamp, prompting for the user\'s password if necessary.  This
       extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever the
       timeout is set to in sudoers) but does not run a command.

   -V  The -V (version) option causes sudo to print the version number and exit.
       If the invoking user is already root the -V option will print out a list of the 
       defaults sudo was compiled with as well as the machine\'s local network addresses.

   --  The -- flag indicates that sudo should stop processing command line
       arguments.  It is most useful in conjunction with the -s flag.', 'bash');

Options:

     -A      Equivalent to -o -a (for compatibility).

     -a      List all the currently available non-opaque values.  This option
             is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on the
             command line.

     -b      Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary format.
             No names are printed and no terminating newlines are output.
             This is mostly useful with a single variable.

     -d      Print the description of the variable instead of its value.

     -e      Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with =.
             This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
             sysctl utility.  This option is ignored if either -N or -n is specified,
             or a variable is being set.

     -h      Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.

     -i      Ignore unknown OIDs.  The purpose is to make use of sysctl for
             collecting data from a variety of machines (not all of which are
             necessarily running exactly the same software) easier.

     -N      Show only variable names, not their values.  This is particularly
             useful with shells that offer programmable completion.  To enable
             completion of variable names in zsh(1) (ports/shells/zsh), use
             the following code:

                   listsysctls () { set -A reply $(sysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
                   compctl -K listsysctls sysctl

             To enable completion of variable names in tcsh(1), use:

                   complete sysctl \'n/*/`sysctl -Na`/\'

     -n      Show only variable values, not their names.
             This option is useful for setting shell variables.

Options:
       -A     Print each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII.  Handy for capturing web pages.

       -B     Set the operating system capture buffer size to buffer_size.

       -c     Exit after receiving count packets.

       -C     Before  writing  a  raw  packet to a savefile, check whether the file is currently larger than
              file_size and, if so, close the current savefile and open a  new  one.   Savefiles  after  the
              first savefile will have the name specified with the -w flag, with a number after it, starting
              at 1 and continuing upward.  The units of file_size are millions of  bytes  (1,000,000  bytes,
              not 1,048,576 bytes).

       -d     Dump the compiled packet-matching code in a human readable form to standard output and stop.

       -dd    Dump packet-matching code as a C program fragment.

       -ddd   Dump packet-matching code as decimal numbers (preceded with a count).

       -D     Print the list of the network interfaces available on the system and on which tcpdump can capture
              packets.  For each network interface, a number and an interface name, possibly  followed
              by  a  text description of the interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be
              supplied to the -i flag to specify an interface on which to capture.

              This can be useful on systems that don\'t have a command to list them (e.g., Windows  systems,
              or  UNIX systems lacking ifconfig -a); the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems,
              where the interface name is a somewhat complex string.

              The -D flag will not be supported if tcpdump was built with an older version of libpcap that
              lacks the pcap_findalldevs() function.

       -e     Print the link-level header on each dump line.

       -E     Use  spi@ipaddr  algo:secret  for  decrypting IPsec ESP packets that are addressed to addr and
              contain Security Parameter Index value spi. This combination may be repeated with comma or
              newline separation.

              Note that setting the secret for IPv4 ESP packets is supported at this time.

              Algorithms may be des-cbc, 3des-cbc, blowfish-cbc, rc3-cbc, cast128-cbc, or none. The default
              is des-cbc. The ability to decrypt packets is only present if tcpdump was compiled with cryptography
              enabled.

              secret is the ASCII text for ESP secret key. If preceeded by 0x, then a hex value will be read.

              The option assumes RFC2406 ESP, not RFC1827 ESP.  The option is only for debugging  purposes,
              and  the  use  of  this  option  with a true \'secret\' key is discouraged.  By presenting IPsec
              secret key onto command line you make it visible to others, via ps(1) and other occasions.

              In addition to the above syntax, the syntax file name may be used to  have  tcpdump  read  the
              provided  file in. The file is opened upon receiving the first ESP packet, so any special permissions
              that tcpdump may have been given should already have been given up.

       -f     Print \'foreign\' IPv4 addresses numerically rather than symbolically (this option is intended
              to get around serious brain damage in Sun\'s NIS server -- usually it hangs forever translating
              non-local internet numbers).

              The test for \'foreign\' IPv4 addresses is done using the IPv4 address and netmask of the interface
               on which capture is being done.  If that address or netmask are not available, available,
              either because the interface on which capture is being done  has  no  address  or  netmask  or
              because the capture is being done on the Linux "any" interface, which can capture on more than
              one interface, this option will not work correctly.

       -F     Use file as input for the filter expression.  An additional expression given  on  the  command
              line is ignored.

       -g     Do not insert line break after IP header in verbose mode for easier parsing.

       -G     If specified, rotates the dump file specified with the -w option every rotate_seconds seconds.
              Savefiles will have the name specified by -w which should include a time format as defined  by
              strftime(3).  If no time format is specified, each new file will overwrite the previous.

              If used in conjunction with the -C option, filenames will take the form of \'filecount\'.

       -i     Listen  on interface.  If unspecified, tcpdump searches the system interface list for the lowest
              numbered, configured up interface (excluding loopback).  Ties are broken by  choosing  the
              earliest match.
              On  Linux  systems  with 2.2 or later kernels, an interface argument of \'any\' can be used to
              capture packets from all interfaces.  Note that captures on the \'any\'  device  will  not  be
              done in promiscuous mode.

              If  the  -D  flag is supported, an interface number as printed by that flag can be used as the
              interface argument.

       -I     Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11  Wi-Fi  interfaces,
              and supported only on some operating systems.

              Note  that  in  monitor  mode  the adapter might disassociate from the network with which it\'s
              associated, so that you will not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter.  This
              could  prevent  accessing  files  on  a  network  server,  or  resolving host names or network
              addresses, if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network  with
              another adapter.

       -K     Don\'t attempt to verify TCP, UDP and IP checksums.  This is useful for interfaces that perform
              the checksum calculation in hardware; otherwise, all outgoing checksums  will  be  flagged  as
              bad.

       -l     Make stdout line buffered.  Useful if you want to see the data while capturing it.  E.g.,
              \'tcpdump  -l  |  tee dat\' or \'tcpdump  -l   > dat  &  tail  -f  dat\'.

       -L     List the known data link types for the interface and exit.

       -m     Load  SMI  MIB  module definitions from file module.  This option can be used several times to
              load several MIB modules into tcpdump.

       -M     Use secret as a shared secret for validating the digests found in TCP segments with  the  TCP-MD5
              MD5 option (RFC 2385), if present.

       -n     Don\'t convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.

       -N     Don\'t print domain name qualification of host names.  E.g., if you give this flag then tcpdump
              will print \'nic\' instead of \'nic.ddn.mil\'.

       -O     Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer. This is useful only if you suspect a bug in
              the optimizer.

       -p     Don\'t  put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the interface might be in promiscuous
              mode for some other reason; hence, \'-p\' cannot be used as an abbreviation for \'ether  host
              {local-hw-addr} or ether broadcast\'.

       -q     Quick (quiet?) output. Print less protocol information so output lines are shorter.

       -R     Assume  ESP/AH  packets  to be based on old specification (RFC1825 to RFC1829).  If specified,
              tcpdump will not print replay prevention field.  Since there is no protocol version  field  in
              ESP/AH specification, tcpdump cannot deduce the version of ESP/AH protocol.

       -r     Read packets from file (which was created with the -w option). Standard input is used if file
              is \'-\'.

       -S     Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.

       -s     Snarf snaplen bytes of data from each packet rather than the default of  64K  bytes. Packets
              truncated  because  of a limited snapshot are indicated in the output with \'[|proto]\', where
              proto is the name of the protocol level at which the truncation has occurred.  Note that taking
              larger snapshots both increases the amount of time it takes to process packets and,effectively,
              decreases the amount of packet buffering. This may cause packets to  be lost. You
              should  limit snaplen to the smallest number that will capture the protocol information you\'re
              interested in. Setting snaplen to 0 means use the required length to catch whole packets.

       -T     Force packets selected by "expression" to be interpreted the specified type.  Currently  known
              types are aodv (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector protocol), cnfp (Cisco NetFlow protocol), rpc
              (Remote Procedure Call), rtp (Real-Time Applications protocol), rtcp  (Real-Time  Applications
              control protocol), snmp (Simple Network Management Protocol), tftp (Trivial File Transfer Protocol),
              , vat (Visual Audio Tool), and wb (distributed White Board).

       -t     Don\'t print a timestamp on each dump line.

       -tt    Print an unformatted timestamp on each dump line.

       -ttt   Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and previous line on each dump line.

       -tttt  Print a timestamp in default format proceeded by date on each dump line.

       -ttttt Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and first line on each dump line.

       -u     Print undecoded NFS handles.

       -U     Make output saved via the -w option \'packet-buffered\'; i.e., as each  packet  is  saved,  it
              will  be  written  to  the  output file, rather than being written only when the output buffer
              fills.

              The -U flag will not be supported if tcpdump was built with an older version of  libpcap  that
              lacks the pcap_dump_flush() function.

       -v     When  parsing  and printing, produce (slightly more) verbose output.  For example, the time to
              live, identification, total length and options in an IP  packet  are  printed.   Also  enables
              additional packet integrity checks such as verifying the IP and ICMP header checksum.

              When  writing  to  a  file with the -w option, report, every 10 seconds, the number of packets
              captured.

       -vv    Even more verbose output.  For example, additional fields are printed from NFS reply  packets,
              and SMB packets are fully decoded.

       -vvv   Even more verbose output.  For example, telnet SB ... SE options are printed in full.  With -X
              Telnet options are printed in hex as well.

       -w     Write the raw packets to file rather than parsing and printing them out.  They  can  later  be
              printed with the -r option.  Standard output is used if file is \'-\'.

       -W     Used  in  conjunction  with  the -C option, this will limit the number of files created to the
              specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating  a  \'rotating\'
              buffer.   In  addition,  it  will name the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum
              number of files, allowing them to sort correctly.

              Used in conjunction with the -G option, this will limit the number of rotated dump files  that
              get  created,  exiting  with  status  0  when reaching the limit. If used with -C as well, the
              behavior will result in cyclical files per timeslice.

       -x     When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the  data
              of  each  packet  (minus  its  link level header) in hex.  The smaller of the entire packet or
              snaplen bytes will be printed.  Note that this is the entire link-layer packet,  so  for  link
              layers  that pad (e.g. Ethernet), the padding bytes will also be printed when the higher layer
              packet is shorter than the required padding.

       -xx    When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the  data
              of each packet, including its link level header, in hex.

       -X     When  parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data
              of each packet (minus its link level header) in  hex  and  ASCII.   This  is  very  handy  for
              analysing new protocols.

       -XX    When  parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data
              of each packet, including its link level header, in hex and ASCII.

       -y     Set the data link type to use while capturing packets to datalinktype.

       -z     Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make tcpdump run  "  command  file  "
              where  file  is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip
              or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.

              Note that tcpdump will run the command in parallel to the capture, using the  lowest  priority
              so that this doesn\'t disturb the capture process.

              And  in  case  you would like to use a command that itself takes flags or different arguments,
              you can always write a shell script that will take the savefile name  as  the  only  argument,
              make the flags & arguments arrangements and execute the command that you want.

       -Z     Drops  privileges  (if root) and changes user ID to user and the group ID to the primary group
              of user.

              This behavior can also be enabled by default at compile time.

       expression
              selects which packets will be dumped.  If no expression is given, all packets on the net  will
              be dumped.  Otherwise, only packets for which expression is \'true\' will be dumped.

              For the expression syntax, see pcap-filter(4).

              Expression arguments can be passed to tcpdump as either a single argument or as multiple arguments,
              whichever is more convenient.  Generally, if the expression contains Shell  metacharacters,
              it  is easier to pass it as a single, quoted argument.  Multiple arguments are concatenated
              with spaces before being parsed.

BACKUP STRUCTURE
     Throughout this manual, specific language is used to describe particular "realms" associated with Time
     Machine backups. It is important to understand this terminology to make effective use of tmutil and its
     manual.

     backup source
             A volume currently being backed up by Time Machine.

     backup disk
             The HFS+ volume that contains Time Machine backups.

     backup destination
             In the case of a local destination, a synonym for backup disk. For network destinations, this
             is the AFP share on which the backup disk image resides.

     backup disk image (or backup image)
             A sparsebundle that, when mounted, is the backing store for a volume that is a backup disk.

     backup store
             The top-level "Backups.backupdb" directory at the root of a backup disk.

     machine directory
             A directory inside a backup store that contains all the backups for a particular computer. For
             local destinations, a backup store can contain multiple machine directories, all for separate
             computers.

     snapshot
             A directory inside a machine directory that represents a single initial or incremental backup
             of one computer. The word "snapshot", in most contexts, is a generic term and is not to be confused
             with a "local Time Machine snapshot", which is a snapshot stored locally on the
             computer.

     snapshot volume
             A directory inside a snapshot that represents a single initial or incremental backup of one
             backup source. E.g.,

             /Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/thermopylae/2011-07-03-123456/Mac HD

VERBS
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

     help [verb]
             Print extended usage for a given verb. If no verb is provided, print a list of verbs and usage
             summaries.

     enable
             Turn on automatic backups. Requires root privileges.

     disable
             Turn off automatic backups. Requires root privileges.

     enablelocal
             Turn on local Time Machine snapshots. Requires root privileges.

     disablelocal
             Turn off local Time Machine snapshots and trigger automatic cleanup of accumulated local snapshot
             data. Requires root privileges.

     snapshot
             Create new local Time Machine snapshot.

     startbackup [-b | --block] [-r | --rotation] [-d | --destination dest_id]
             Perform a standard backup. This is equivalent to choosing "Back Up Now" from the Time Machine
             menu extra.

             Options:
                 --block          Wait (block) until the backup is finished before exiting.
                 --rotation       Allow automatic destination rotation during the backup.
                 --destination    Perform the backup to the destination corresponding to the specified ID.

     stopbackup
             Cancel a backup currently in progress.

     delete snapshot_path ...
             Delete one or more snapshots in an arbitrary machine directory. This verb can delete snapshots
             from backups that were not made by, or are not claimed by, the current machine. Requires root
             privileges.

     restore [-v] src ... dst
             Restore the item src, which is inside a snapshot, to the location dst. The dst argument mimics
             the destination path semantics of the cp tool. You may provide multiple source paths to
             restore. The last path argument must be a destination.

             When using the restore verb, tmutil behaves largely like Finder. Custom Time Machine metadata
             (extended security and other) will be removed from the restored data, and other metadata will
             be preserved.

             Root privileges are not strictly required to perform restores, but tmutil does no permissions
             preflighting to determine your ability to restore src or its descendants. Therefore, depending
             on what you\'re restoring, you may need root privileges to perform the restore, and you should
             know this ahead of time. This is the same behavior you would encounter with other copy tools
             such as cp or ditto. When restoring with tmutil as root, ownership of the restored items will
             match the state of the items in the backup.

     compare [-@esmugtdEX] [-D depth] [-I name] [snapshot_path | path1 path2]
             Perform a backup diff.

             If no arguments are provided, tmutil will compare the computer to the latest snapshot. If a
             snapshot path is provided as the sole argument, tmutil will compare the computer to the specified
             snapshot. If two path arguments are provided, tmutil will compare those two items to each
             other.  tmutil will attempt to inform you when you have asked it to do something that doesn\'t
             make sense or isn\'t supported.

             The compare verb allows you to specify what properties to compare. If you specify no property
             options, it is assumed that you want to compare a basic set of metadata. This default property
             set is equivalent to the -smugt option set. Specifying any property option overrides the
             default set.

             Options:
                 -a    Compare all supported metadata.
                 -@    Compare extended attributes.
                 -e    Compare ACLs.
                 -s    Compare sizes.
                 -m    Compare file modes.
                 -u    Compare UIDs.
                 -g    Compare GIDs.
                 -t    Compare modification times.
                 -d    Compare file data forks.
                 -D    Limit traversal depth to depth levels from the beginning of iteration.
                 -E    Don\'t take exclusions into account when comparing items inside volumes.
                 -I    Ignore paths with a path component equal to name during iteration. This may be specified
                       multiple times.
                 -X    Print output in XML property list format.

     setdestination [-ap] arg
             Configure a local HFS+ volume or AFP share as a backup destination. Requires root privileges.

             When the -a option is provided, arg will be added to the list of destinations. Time Machine
             will automatically choose a backup destination from the list when performing backups. When the
             -a option is not provided, the current list of destinations will be replaced by arg.

             If you wish to set an HFS+ volume as the backup destination, arg should be the mount point of
             the volume in question. When setting an AFP destination arg takes the form:

             afp://user[:pass]@host/share

             In the AFP case, the password component of the URL is optional; you may instead specify the -p
             option to enter the password at a non-echoing interactive prompt. This is of particular interest
             to the security-conscious, as all arguments provided to a program are visible by all users
             on the system via the ps tool.

     destinationinfo [-X]
             Print information about destinations currently configured for use with Time Machine. For each
             backup destination, the following information may be displayed:

                 Name          The volume label as shown in Finder.
                 Kind          Whether the destination is locally attached storage or a network device.
                 URL           In the case of a network destination, the URL used for Time Machine configuration.
                 Mount Point   If the volume is currently mounted, the path in the file system at which it
                               was mounted.
                 ID            The unique identifier for the destination.

             When more than one destination is configured, the most recent backup destination will be marked
             with the > indicator.

             When the -X option is provided, output will be printed in XML property list format.

     removedestination identifier
             Remove the destination with the specified unique identifier from the Time Machine configuration.
             Requires root privileges.

             To obtain the unique identifier for a destination, see destinationinfo.

     addexclusion [-p] item ...
             Configure an exclusion that tells Time Machine not to back up a file, directory, or volume during
             future backups.

             There are two kinds of user-configurable exclusions in Time Machine. The first, which is the
             default behavior for the addexclusion verb, is a location-independent ("sticky") exclusion that
             follows a file or directory. When the file or directory is moved, the exclusion goes with the
             item to the new location. Additionally, when the item is copied, the copy retains the exclusion.

             The second kind of exclusion is what is known as a fixed-path exclusion. In this scenario, you
             tell Time Machine that you want a specific path to be excluded, agnostic of the item at that
             path. If there is no file or directory at the specified path, the exclusion has no effect; if
             the item previously at the path has been moved or renamed, the item is not excluded, because it
             does not currently reside at the excluded path. As a consequence of these semantics, moving a
             file or directory to the path will cause the item to be excluded--fixed-path exclusions are not
             automatically cleaned up when items are moved or deleted and will take effect again once an
             item exists at an excluded path.

             The -p option sets a fixed-path exclusion as described above. Requires root privileges.

             Volume exclusions can be set with the addexclusion verb. The -p option is ignored for volumes;
             exclusions set on volumes track the volume regardless of volume name or mount path changes.
             Erasing the volume will cause it to be included in future backups. (See associatedisk.)
             Requires root privileges.

     removeexclusion [-p] item ...
             Configure Time Machine to back up a file, directory, or volume during future backups. This verb
             follows the same usage, exclusion style, and privilege semantics as addexclusion.

     isexcluded [-X] item ...
             Determine if a file, directory, or volume are excluded from Time Machine backups.

             When the -X option is provided, output will be printed in XML property list format.

             # example output for an excluded item

     inheritbackup {machine_directory | sparsebundle}
             Claim a machine directory or sparsebundle for use by the current machine. Requires root privileges.

             Machine directories and sparsebundles are owned by one computer at a time, and are tracked by
             unique identifiers rather than computer name, host name, or ethernet address. The inheritbackup
             verb reassigns the identity of the specified item, reconfiguring it so the current host recognizes
             it during backups. When inheriting a sparsebundle, the machine directory within will also
             be claimed.

             Inheriting is typically only one step in the process of configuring a backup for use by a
             machine. You may also need to use setdestination, associatedisk, or both, depending on the situation.

             One machine can own multiple machine directories and sparsebundles, but it is ill-advised for
             them to reside in the same place. In such a situation, which will be chosen during a backup is
             undefined. As a result, inheritbackup will attempt to detect possible identity collisions
             before making changes.

     associatedisk [-a] mount_point snapshot_volume
             Bind a snapshot volume directory to the specified local disk, thereby reconfiguring the backup
             history. Requires root privileges.

             In macOS, HFS+ volumes have a persistent UUID that is assigned when the file system is created.
             Time Machine uses this identifier to make an association between a source volume and a
             snapshot volume. Erasing the source volume creates a new file system on the disk, and the previous
              UUID is not retained. The new UUID causes the source volume -> snapshot volume assocation
             to be broken. If one were just erasing the volume and starting over, it would likely be of no
             real consequence, and the new UUID would not be a concern; when erasing a volume in order to
             clone another volume to it, recreating the association may be desired.

             A concrete example of when and how you would use associatedisk:

             After having problems with a volume, you decide to erase it and manually restore its contents
             from a Time Machine backup or copy of another nature. (I.e., not via the macOS installer\'s
             System Restore feature or Migration Assistant.) On your next incremental backup, the data will
             be copied anew, as though none of it had been backed up before. Technically, it is true that
             the data has not been backed up, given the new UUID. However, this is probably not what you
             want Time Machine to do. You would then use associatedisk to reconfigure the backup so it
             appears that this volume has been backed up previously:

             Mac64:~ thoth$ sudo tmutil associatedisk [-a] "/Volumes/MyNewStuffDisk"  "/Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/Mac64/Latest/MyStuff"

             The result of the above command would associate the snapshot volume MyStuff in the specified
             snapshot with the source volume MyNewStuffDisk. The snapshot volume would also be renamed to
             match. The -a option tells associatedisk to find all snapshot volumes in the same machine
             directory that match the identity of MyStuff, and then perform the association on all of them.

     latestbackup
             Print the path to the most recent snapshot for this computer.

     calculatedrift machine_directory
             Analyze the snapshots in a machine directory and determine the amount of change between each.
             Averages are printed after all snapshots have been analyzed. This may require root privileges,
             depending on the contents of the machine directory.

     uniquesize path ...
             Analyze the specified path and determine its unique size. The figure reported by uniquesize
             represents things that only exist in the specified path; things that are hard-linked in other
             places are not tallied.

   -D         A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed

              This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.

   [-+]O [shopt_option]
              shopt_option is one of the  shell  options  accepted  by  the
              shopt   builtin  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below).   If
              shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O
              unsets  it.   If  shopt_option is not supplied, the names and
              values of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed  on
              the  standard  output.   If  the invocation option is +O, the
              output is displayed in a format that can be reused as  input.

   -i         Interactive shell.

   -l         Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell, it
              first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile,
              if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks for
              ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in  that order,
              and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists
              and is readable.  The --noprofile option can be used when the
              shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

   -r         RESTRICTED SHELL prevent changing directory, Shell, Path etc.

   -s         If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after
              option processing,  then commands are read from the standard
              input. This option allows the positional parameters to be
              set when invoking an interactive shell.

   -v         Verbose output.

   --         A -- signals the end of options and disables further option
              processing. Any arguments after the -- are treated as file-
              names and arguments. An argument of - is equivalent to --.

   Bash also interprets a number of multi-character options.
   These options must appear on the command line before the single-character
   options to be recognized.

       --debugger
              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell
              starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see  the  description
              of  the  extdebug  option  to the shopt builtin below) and shell
              function tracing (see the description of the -o functrace option
              to the set builtin below).
       --dump-po-strings
              Equivalent  to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (por-
              table object) file format.
       --dump-strings
              Equivalent to -D.
       --help Display a usage message on standard  output  and  exit  success-
              fully.
       --init-file file
       --rcfile file
              Execute commands from file instead of the standard personal ini-
              tialization file ~/.bashrc if  the  shell  is  interactive  (see
              INVOCATION below).

       --login
              Equivalent to -l.

       --noediting
              Do  not  use the GNU readline library to read command lines when
              the shell is interactive.

       --noprofile
              Do not read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile  or
              any   of  the  personal  initialization  files  ~/.bash_profile,
              ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile.   By  default,  bash  reads  these
              files  when  it  is  invoked  as  a  login shell (see INVOCATION
              below).

       --norc Do not read and execute the personal initialization file
              ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive.  This option is on by
              default if the shell is invoked as sh.

       --posix
              Change the behavior of bash where the default operation  differs
              from the POSIX standard to match the standard (posix mode).

       --restricted
              The shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).

       --verbose
              Equivalent to  -v.

Options
     --all-architectures
             When verifying a code signature on code that has a universal ("fat") Mach-O binary, separately verify each 
             architecture contained. This is the default unless overridden with the -a (--architecture) option.

     -a, --architecture architecture
             When verifying or displaying signatures, explicitly select the Mach-O architecture given. The architecture can be
             specified either by name (e.g. i386) or by number; if by number, a sub-architecture may be appended separated by a comma.
             This option applies only to Mach-O binary code and is ignored for other types.  If the path uses the Mach-O format and
             contains no code of the given architecture, the command will fail.  The default for verification is --all-architec-
             tures, to verify all architectures present.  The default for display is to report on the native architecture of the
             host system.  When signing, codesign will always sign all architectures contained in a universal Mach-O file.

     --bundle-version version-string
             When handling versioned bundles such as frameworks, explicitly specify the version to operate on. This must be one of
             the names in the "Versions" directory of the bundle.  If not specified, codesign uses the bundle\'s default version.
             Note that most frameworks delivered with the system have only one version, and thus this option is irrelevant for them.
             There is currently no facility for operating on all versions of a bundle at once.

     -d, --display
             Display information about the code at the path(s) given. Increasing levels of verbosity produce more output.
             The format is designed to be moderately easy to parse by simple scripts while still making sense to human eyes.  
             In addition, the -r, --file-list, --extract-certificates, and --entitlements options can be used to retrieve
             additional information.

     -D, --detached filename
             When signing, designates that a detached signature should be written to the specified file. The code being signed is
             not modified and need not be writable.  When verifying, designates a file containing a detached signature to be used
             for verification. Any embedded signature in the code is ignored.

     --deep  When signing a bundle, specifies that nested code content such as helpers, frameworks, and plug-ins, should be
             recursively signed in turn. Beware that all signing options you specify will apply, in turn, to such nested content.
             When verifying a bundle, specifies that any nested code content will be recursively verified as to its full content.
             By default, verification of nested content is limited to a shallow investigation that may not detect changes to
             the nested code.
             When displaying a signature, specifies that a list of directly nested code should be written to the display output.
             This lists only code directly nested within the subject; anything nested indirectly will require recursive
             application of the codesign command.

     --detached-database
             When signing, specifies that a detached signature should be generated as with the --detached option, but that the
             resulting signature should be written into a system database, from where it is made automatically available whenever
             apparently unsigned code is validated on the system.
             Writing to this system database requires elevated process privileges that are not available to ordinary users.

     -f, --force
             When signing, causes codesign to replace any existing signature on the path(s) given. Without this option, existing
             signatures will not be replaced, and the signing operation fails.

     -h, --hosting
             Constructs and prints the hosting chain of a running program. The pid arguments must denote running code (pids etc.)
             With verbose options, this also displays the individual dynamic validity status of each element of the hosting chain.

     -i, --identifier identifier
             During signing, explicitly specify the unique identifier string that is embedded in code signatures. If this option is
             omitted, the identifier is derived from either the Info.plist (if present), or the filename of the executable being
             signed, possibly modified by the --prefix option.  It is a very bad idea to sign different programs with the same
             identifier.

     -o, --options flag,...
             During signing, specifies a set of option flags to be embedded in the code signature. The value takes the form of a
             comma-separated list of names (with no spaces). Alternatively, a numeric value can be used to directly specify the
             option mask (CodeDirectory flag word). See OPTION FLAGS below.

     -P, --pagesize pagesize
             Indicates the granularity of code signing. Pagesize must be a power of two.  Chunks of pagesize bytes are separately
             signed and can thus be independently verified as needed.  As a special case, a pagesize of zero indicates that the
             entire code should be signed and verified as a single, possibly gigantic page. This option only applies to the main
             executable and has no effect on the sealing of associated data, including resources.

     -r, --requirements requirements
             During signing, indicates that internal requirements should be embedded in the code path(s) as specified. 
             See "specifying requirements" below.  Defaults will be applied to requirement types that are not explicitly
             specified; if you want to defeat such a default, specify "never" for that type.
             During display, indicates where to write the code\'s internal requirements. Use -r- to write them to standard output.

     -R, --test-requirement requirement
             During verification, indicates that the path(s) given should be verified against the code requirement specified.
             If this option is omitted, the code is verified only for internal integrity and against its own designated requirement.

     -s, --sign identity
             Sign the code at the path(s) given using this identity. See SIGNING IDENTITIES below.

     -v, --verbose
             Sets (with a numeric value) or increments the verbosity level of output. Without the verbose option, no output is
             produced upon success, in the classic UNIX style.  If no other options request a different action, the first -v
             encountered will be interpreted as --verify instead (and does not increase verbosity).

     -v, --verify
             Requests verification of code signatures.  If other actions (sign, display, etc.) are also requested,
             -v is interpreted to mean --verbose.

     --continue
             Instructs codesign to continue processing path arguments even if processing one fails.  If this option is given, exit
             due to operational errors is deferred until all path arguments have been considered. The exit code will then indicate
             the most severe failure (or, with equal severity, the first such failure encountered).

     --dryrun
             During signing, performs almost all signing operations, but does not actually write the result anywhere. Cryptographic
             signatures are still generated, actually using the given signing identity and triggering any access control checks
             normally, though the resulting signature is then discarded.

     --entitlements path
             When signing, take the file at the given path and embed its contents in the signature as entitlement data. If the data
             at path does not already begin with a suitable binary ("blob") header, one is attached automatically.
             When displaying a signature, extract any entitlement data from the signature and write it to the path given. Use "-" to
             write to standard output.  By default, the binary "blob" header is returned intact; prefix the path with a colon ":" to
             automatically strip it off.  If the signature has no entitlement data, nothing is written (this is not an error).

     --extract-certificates prefix
             When displaying a signature, extract the certificates in the embedded certificate chain and write them to individual
             files. The prefix argument is appended with numbers 0, 1, ... to form the filenames, which can be relative or absolute.
             Certificate 0 is the leaf (signing) certificate, and as many files are written as there are certificates in the
             signature. The files are in ASN.1 (DER) form.  If prefix is omitted, the default prefix is "codesign" in the current
             directory.

     --file-list path
             When signing or displaying a signature, codesign writes to the given path a list of files that may have been modified
             as part of the signing process. This is useful for installer or patcher programs that need to know what was changed or
             what files are needed to make up the "signature" of a program. The file given is appended-to, with one line per
             absolute path written. An argument of "-" (single dash) denotes standard output.  Note that the list may be somewhat
             pessimistic - all files not listed are guaranteed to be unchanged by the signing process, but some of the listed files may
             not actually have changed.  Also note that changes may have been made to extended attributes of these files.

     --ignore-resources
             During static validation, do not validate the contents of the code\'s resources.  In effect, this will pass validation
             on code whose resources have been corrupted (or inappropriately signed). On large programs, it will also substantially
             speed up static validation, since all the resources will not be read into memory.  Obviously, the outcome of such a
             validation should be considered on its merits.

     --keychain filename
             During signing, only search for the signing identity in the keychain file specified. This can be used to break any
             matching ties if you have multiple similarly-named identities in several keychains on the user\'s search list.  Note
             that the standard keychain search path is still consulted while constructing the certificate chain being embedded in
             the signature.
             Note that filename will not be searched to resolve the signing identity\'s certificate chain unless it is also on the
             user\'s keychain search list.

     --prefix string
             If no explicit unique identifier is specified (using the -i option), and if the implicitly generated identifier does
             not contain any dot (.) characters, then the given string is prefixed to the identifier before use. If the implicit
             identifier contains a dot, it is used as-is. Typically, this is used to deal with command tools without Info.plists,
             whose default identifier is simply the command\'s filename; the conventional prefix used is com.domain. (note that the
             final dot needs to be explicit).

     --preserve-metadata=list
             When re-signing code that is already signed, reuse some information from the old signature.  If new data is specified
             explicitly, it is preferred.  You still need to specify the -f (--force) option to enable overwriting signatures at
             all.  If this option is absent, any old signature has no effect on the signing process.
             This option takes a comma-separated list of names, which you may reasonably abbreviate:

             identifier    Preserve the signing identifier (--identifier) instead of generating a default identifier.

             entitlements  Preserve the entitlement data (--entitlements).

             requirements  Preserve the internal requirements (--requirements option), including any explicit Designated
                           Requirement. Note that all internal requirements are preserved or regenerated as a whole; you
                           cannot pick and choose individual elements with this option.
             For historical reasons, this option can be given without a value, which preserves all of these values as presently
             known. This use is deprecated and will eventually be removed; always specify an explicit list of preserved items.

     --strict options
             When validating code, apply additional restrictions beyond the defaults.

             symlinks  Check that symbolic links inside the code bundle point to sealed files inside its bundle.  This means that
                       broken symbolic links are rejected, as are links to places outside the bundle and to places that are not,
                       for whatever reason, sealed by the signature.

             sideband  Check that no resource forks, Finder attributes, or similar sideband data is present in the signed code.
                       This is now automatically enforced by signing operations.
             Options can be specified as a comma-separated list. Use plain --strict or --strict=all to be as strict as possible.
             Note that --strict=all may include more checking types over time.
             Not all strictness check make sense in all circumstances, which is why these behaviors are not the defualt.

     --timestamp [=URL]
             During signing, requests that a timestamp authority server be contacted to authenticate the time of signing. The server
             contacted is given by the URL value.  If this option is given without a value, a default server provided by Apple is
             used.  Note that this server may not support signatures made with identities not furnished by Apple.  If the timestamp
             authority service cannot be contacted over the Internet, or it malfunctions or refuses service, the signing operation
             will fail.
             If this option is not given at all, a system-specific default behavior is invoked.  This may result in some but not all
             code signatures being timestamped.
             The special value none explicitly disables the use of timestamp services.', 'osx');

Key:
   -R   Copy the folder and subtree (recursive).  
        If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory and
        the entire subtree connected at that point.  If the source_file
        ends in a /, the contents of the directory are copied rather than
        the directory itself.  This option also causes symbolic links to be
        copied, rather than indirected through, and for cp to create special
        files rather than copying them as normal files.  Created
        directories have the same mode as the corresponding source directory,
        unmodified by the process\' umask.

        COMPATIBILITY Historic versions of the cp utility had a -r option.
        This implementation supports that option; however, its use is strongly
        discouraged, as it does not correctly copy special files, symbolic links, or fifo\'s.

        A Homebrew-installed (GNU) cp does not have this limitation.

   -H   Symbolic links on the command line are followed.
        (but Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)

   -L   All symbolic links are followed.

   -P   No symbolic links are followed. This is the default.

   -f   For each existing destination pathname, remove it and create a new
        file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its permissions.
        (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n options.)

   -i   Cause cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before
        copying a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the
        response from the standard input begins with the character \'y\' or
        \'Y\', the file copy is attempted.  (The -i option overrides any
        previous -f or -n options.)

   -n   Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any
        previous -f or -i options.)

   -p   Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source file
        in the copy: modification time, access time, file flags, file mode,
        user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.  Access Control
        Lists (ACLs) will also be preserved.

        If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message

      cpio -o [options] < name-list [> archive]

   The first option to cpio is a mode indicator from the following list:

      -i    Copy-in mode.  Read an archive from standard input (unless overriden) and extract the contents to disk
            or (if the -t option is specified) list the contents to standard output.
            If one or more file patterns are specified, only files matching one of the patterns will be extracted.

      -o    Copy-out mode.  Read a list of filenames, one per line, from standard input and produce a new archive on standard output
            (unless overriden) containing the specified items.

      -p    Pass-thru mode.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and copy the files to the specified directory.
            This combines the copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using an archive.

Options:

   Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in all operating modes.

   -0    Read filenames separated by NUL characters instead of newlines.
         This is necessary if any of the filenames being read might contain newlines.
         find is one way to produce a list of null-terminated filenames.

   -A    (o mode only) Append to the specified archive.  (Not yet implemented.)

   -a    (o and p modes) Reset access times on files after they are read.

   -B    (o mode only) Block output to records of 5120 bytes.

   -C size  (o mode only) Block output to records of size bytes.

   -c    (o mode only) Use the old POSIX portable character format.  Equivalent to --format odc.

   -d    (i and p modes) Create directories as necessary.

   -E file   (i mode only) Read list of file name patterns from file to list and extract.

   -F file   Read archive from or write archive to file.

   -f pattern
           (i mode only) Ignore files that match pattern.

   --format format
           (o mode only) Produce the output archive in the specified format.  Supported formats include:

           cpio     Synonym for odc.
           newc     The SVR4 portable cpio format.
           odc      The old POSIX.1 portable octet-oriented cpio format.
           pax      The POSIX.1 pax format, an extension of the ustar format.
           ustar    The POSIX.1 tar format.

           The default format is odc.
           See libarchive_formats(5) for more complete information about the formats currently supported
           by the underlying libarchive(3) library.

   -H format
           Synonym for --format.

   -h, --help
           Print usage information.

   -I file
         Read archive from file.

   -i    Input mode.  See above for description.

   --insecure
         (i and p mode only) Disable security checks during extraction or copying.
         This allows extraction via symbolic links and path names containing .. in the name.

   -J    (o mode only) Compress the file with xz-compatible compression before writing it.
         In input mode, this option is ignored; xz compression is recognized automatically on input.

   -j    Synonym for -y.

   -L    (o and p modes) All symbolic links will be followed.
         Normally, symbolic links are archived and copied as symbolic links.
         With this option, the target of the link will be archived or copied instead.

   -l    (p mode only) Create links from the target directory to the original files, instead of copying.

   -lzma (o mode only) Compress the file with lzma-compatible compression before writing it.
         In input mode, this option is ignored; lzma compression is recognized automatically on input.

   -m    (i and p modes) Set file modification time on created files to match those in the source.

   -n    (i mode, only with -t) Display numeric uid and gid.
         By default, cpio displays the user and group names when they are provided in the
         archive, or looks up the user and group names in the system password database.

   -no-preserve-owner
         (i mode only) Do not attempt to restore file ownership.  This is the default when run by non-root users.

   -O file   Write archive to file.

   -o    Output mode.  See above for description.

   -p    Pass-through mode.  See above for description.

   -preserve-owner
         (i mode only) Restore file ownership.  This is the default when run by the root user.

   --quiet   Suppress unnecessary messages.

   -R [user][:][group]
           Set the owner and/or group on files in the output.
           If group is specified with no user (for example, -R :wheel) then the group will be
           set but not the user.  If the user is specified with a trailing colon and no group (for example, -R root:)
           then the group will be set to the user\'s default group.
           If the user is specified with no trailing colon, then the user will be set but not the group.
           In -i and -p modes, this option can only be used by the super-user.
           (For compatibility, a period can be used in place of the colon.)

   -r     (All modes.)  Rename files interactively.  For each file, a prompt is written to /dev/tty containing
           the name of the file and a line is read from /dev/tty.
           If the line read is blank, the file is skipped.  If the line contains a single period, the file
           is processed normally.  Otherwise, the line is taken to be the new name of the file.

   -t      (i mode only) List the contents of the archive to stdout; do not restore the contents to disk.

   -u      (i and p modes) Unconditionally overwrite existing files.  Ordinarily, an older file will not overwrite a newer file on disk.

   -v      Print the name of each file to stderr as it is processed.  With -t, provide a detailed listing of each file.

   --version
           Print the program version information and exit.

   -y      (o mode only) Compress the archive with bzip2-compatible compression before writing it.
           In input mode, this option is ignored; bzip2 compression is recognized automatically on input.

   -Z      (o mode only) Compress the archive with compress-compatible compression before writing it.
           In input mode, this option is ignored; compression is recognized automatically on input.

   -z      (o mode only) Compress the archive with gzip-compatible compression before writing it.
           In input mode, this option is ignored; gzip compression is recognized automatically on input.

     -s      Enable special handling of situations when the GMT offset of the
             local timezone changes, such as the switches between the standard
             time and daylight saving time.

             The jobs run during the GMT offset changes time as intuitively
             expected.  If a job falls into a time interval that disappears
             (for example, during the switch from standard time) to daylight
             saving time or is duplicated (for example, during the reverse
             switch), then it\'s handled in one of two ways:

             The first case is for the jobs that run every at hour of a time
             interval overlapping with the disappearing or duplicated inter-
             val.  In other words, if the job had run within one hour before
             the GMT offset change (and cron was not restarted nor the
             crontab changed after that) or would run after the change at
             the next hour.  They work as always, skip the skipped time or run
             in the added time as usual.

             The second case is for the jobs that run less frequently.  They
             are executed exactly once, they are not skipped nor executed
             twice (unless cron is restarted or the user\'s crontab is
             changed during such a time interval).  If an interval disappears
             due to the GMT offset change, such jobs are executed at the same
             absolute point of time as they would be in the old time zone.
             For example, if exactly one hour disappears, this point would be
             during the next hour at the first minute that is specified for
             them in crontab.

   -A "agent string"
   --user-agent "agent string"
        Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
        To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
        quote marks. This can also be set with -H, --header option. (HTTP)

   -b name=data
   --cookie name=data
        Send the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data
        previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.
        The data should be in the format  "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

   -c filename
   --cookie-jar file name
        Save cookies to file after a completed operation.
        Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file
        as well as all cookies received from remote server(s).
        If no cookies are known, no file will be written.
        TO write to stdout, set the file name to a single dash,  "-"

   --compressed
         Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
        curl supports (gzip), and save  the  uncompressed  document.
        If this option  is  used  and  the server sends an unsupported encoding,
        curl will report an error.(HTTP)

   -d @file
   -d "string"
   --data "string"
        Send the specified data in an (HTTP) POST request, in the same way that a
        web browser does.
        This  will pass the data using the content-type
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

        -d, --data is the same as  --data-ascii.  To post data in pure binary, use --data-binary.
        To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

        Multiple date options will be merged together.
        Thus,  using  \'-d  name=daniel  -d skill=lousy\' would generate a post
        that looks like  \'name=daniel&skill=lousy\'.

        If the data starts with @, the rest should be a filename containing the data.
  
   -f, --fail
        (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors.
        This is mostly done to enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts.
        In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document
        stating so (which often also describes why and more).

      date [-jnu] [-I[FMT]] [-f input_fmt] [-r ...] [-v ...] [new_date]

Key
   -f      Use input_fmt as the format string to parse the new_date provided rather than using the
           default [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss] format.  Parsing is done using strptime(3).

   -I[FMT]
           Use ISO 8601 output format.  FMT may be omitted, in which case the default is \'date\'.
           Valid FMT values are ‘date’, ‘hours’, ‘minutes’, and ‘seconds’.
           The date and time is formatted to the specified precision.  When FMT is ‘hours’ (or the more
           precise ‘minutes’ or ‘seconds’), the ISO 8601 format includes the timezone.

   -j      Do not try to set the date.  This allows you to use the -f flag in addition to the + option
           to convert one date format to another.  Note that any date or time components unspecified
           by the -f format string take their values from the current time.

   -n      Obsolete flag, accepted and ignored for compatibility.

   -R      Use RFC 2822 date and time output format.
           This is equivalent to using "%a, %d %b %Y %T %z" as output_fmt while LC_TIME is set to the "C" locale.

   -r seconds
           Print the date and time represented by seconds, where seconds is the number of seconds since
           the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970; see time(3)), and can be specified in decimal, octal, or hex.

   -r filename
           Print the date and time of the last modification of filename.

   -u      Display or set the date in UTC (Coordinated Universal) time.

   -v      Adjust (i.e., take the current date and display the result of the adjustment; not actually set the date)
           the second, minute, hour, month day, week day, month or year according to val.
           If val is preceded with a plus or minus sign, the date is adjusted forwards or backwards according to the
           remaining string, otherwise the relevant part of the date is set.
           The date can be adjusted as many times as required using these flags. Flags are processed in the order given.

           When setting values (rather than adjusting them), seconds are in the range 0-59, minutes are in the range 0-59,
           hours are in the range 0-23, month days are in the range 1-31, week days are in the range 0-6 (Sun-Sat),
           months are in the range 1-12 (Jan-Dec) and years are in the range 80-38 or 1980-2038.

           If val is numeric, one of either y, m, w, d, H, M or S must be used to specify which part of the date is to
           be adjusted.

           The week day or month may be specified using a name rather than a number.
           If a name is used with the plus (or minus) sign, the date will be put forwards (or backwards) to the next
           (previous) date that matches the given week day or month.  This will not adjust the date, if the given week day
           or month is the same as the current one.

           When a date is adjusted to a specific value or in units greater than hours, daylight savings time considerations
           are ignored.  Adjustments in units of hours or less honor daylight saving time.
           So, assuming the current date is March 26, 0:30 and that the DST adjustment means that the clock goes  forward
           at 01:00 to 02:00, using -v +1H will adjust the date to March 26, 2:30.
           Likewise, if the date is October 29, 0:30 and the DST adjustment means that the clock goes back at 02:00 to 01:00,
           using -v +3H will be necessary to reach October 29, 2:30.

           When the date is adjusted to a specific value that does not actually exist (for example March 26, 1:30 BST 2000
           in the Europe/London timezone), the date will be silently adjusted forwards in units of one hour until it reaches
           a valid time.  When the date is adjusted to a specific value that occurs twice (for example October 29, 1:30 2000),
           the resulting timezone will be set so that the date matches the earlier of the two times.

           It is not possible to adjust a date to an invalid absolute day, so using the switches -v 31d -v 12m will simply fail
           five months of the year.  It is therefore usual to set the month before setting the day; using -v 12m -v 31d always works.

           Adjusting the date by months is inherently ambiguous because a month is a unit of variable length depending
           on the current date.  This kind of date adjustment is applied in the most intuitive way.
           First of all, date tries to preserve the day of the month.  If it is impossible because the target month is shorter
           than the present one, the last day of the target month will be the result.
           For example, using -v +1m on May 31 will adjust the date to June 30, while using the same option on January 30 will
           result in the date adjusted to the last day of February.  This approach is also believed to make the most sense for
           shell scripting.  Nevertheless, be aware that going forth and back by the same number of months may take you to a
           different date.

                [-4] [-6] [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]     dig [-h]

     dig [global-queryopt...] [query...]

Options:

   -4    Force dig to only use IPv4 query transport.

   -6    Force dig to only use IPv6 query transport.

   -b address
         Set the source IP address of the query to address.
         This must be a valid address on one of the host\'s network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or "::".
         An optional port can be specified by appending "#port"

   -c class
         Over-ride the default query class (IN for internet).
         class is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for CHAOSNET records.

   -f filename 
         Operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from a file.
         The file contains a number of queries, one per line.
         Each entry in the file should be organised in the same way they would be presented
         as queries to dig using the command-line interface.

   -m    Enable memory usage debugging.

   -p port#
        Specify a non-standard port number to be queried,
        default = the standard DNS port number 53.
        This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured
        to listen for queries on a non-standard port number.

   -t type
        Set the query type to type, any valid query type which is supported in BIND9.
        The default query type "A", unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup.
        A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR.
        When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, type is set to ixfr=N.
        The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the
        serial number in the zone\'s SOA record was N.

   -x addr
        Reverse lookups - mapping addresses to names: addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-
        decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used,
        there is no need to provide the name, class and type arguments. dig automatically
        performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type
        and class to PTR and IN respectively. By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using
        nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older RFC1886 method using the
        IP6.INT domain specify the -i option. Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental
        and are not attempted.

   -k filename
        Sign the DNS queries sent by dig and their responses using transaction signatures
        (TSIG key file). You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line
        using the -y option; name is the name of the TSIG key and key is the actual key.
        The key is a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by dnssec-keygen(8).
        Caution should be taken when using the -y option on multi-user systems as the key
        can be visible in the output from ps(1 ) or in the shell\'s history file.
        When using TSIG authentication with dig, the name server that is queried needs to
        know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing
        appropriate key and server statements in named.conf.

                   PKZip archives should be stored in filenames ending in .zip.

     --keepParent  When creating an archive, embed the parent directory name src in dst_archive.

     --arch arch   Thin Universal binaries to the specified architecture.
                   If multiple --arch options are specified then the resulting destination file
                   will contain each of the specified architectures (if they are present in the
                   source file).  arch should be specified as "i386", "x86_64", etc.

     --bom bom     Copy only files, links, devices, and directories that are present in the
                   specified BOM.

     --rsrc        Preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data.  ditto will store this data in
                   Carbon-compatible ._ AppleDouble files on filesystems that do not natively 
                   support resource forks.  As of Mac OS X 10.4, --rsrc is default behavior.

     --norsrc      Do not preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data.
                   If both --norsrc and --rsrc are passed, whichever is passed last will take
                   precedence.  Both options override DITTONORSRC.
                   Unless explicitly specified, --norsrc also implies --noextattr and --noacl
                   to match the behavior of Mac OS X 10.4.

     --extattr     Preserve extended attributes (requires --rsrc).
                   As of Mac OS X 10.5, --extattr is the default.

     --noextattr   Do not preserve extended attributes (requires --norsrc).

     --qtn         Preserve quarantine information.  As of Mac OS X 10.5, --qtn is the default.

     --noqtn       Do not preserve quarantine information.

     --acl         Preserve Access Control Lists (ACLs).  As of Mac OS X 10.5, --acl is the default.

     --noacl       Do not preserve ACLs.

     --nocache     Do not perform copies using the Mac OS X Unified Buffer Cache.
                   Files read and written will not be cached, although if the file is
                   already present in the cache, the cached information will be used.

     --hfsCompression
                   When copying files or extracting content from an archive, if the destination is
                   an HFS+ volume that supports compression, all the content will be compressed if
                   appropriate. This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, and is only
                   intended to be used in installation and backup scenarios that involve system files.
                   Since files using HFS+ compression are not readable on versions of Mac OS X earlier
                   than 10.6, this flag should not be used when dealing with non-system files or other
                   user-generated content that will be used on a version of Mac OS X earlier than 10.6.

     --nohfsCompression
                   Do not compress files with HFS+ compression when copying or extracting content
                   from an archive unless the content is already compressed with HFS+ compression.
                   This flag is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.  --nohfsCompression is the default.

     --preserveHFSCompression
                   When copying files to an HFS+ volume that supports compression, ditto will preserve
                   the compression of any source files that were using HFS+ compression.
                   This flag is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.  --preserveHFSCompression is the default.

     --nopreserveHFSCompression
                   Do not preserve HFS+ compression when copying files that are already compressed
                   with HFS+ compression. This is only supported on Mac OS X 10.6 or later.

     --sequesterRsrc
                   When creating a PKZip archive, preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data in the
                   subdirectory __MACOSX.  PKZip extraction will automatically find these resources.

     --zlibCompressionLevel num
                   Sets the compression level to use when creating a PKZip archive. The compression
                   level can be set from 0 to 9, where 0 represents no compression, and 9 represents
                   optimal (slowest) compression.
                   By default, ditto will use the default compression level as defined by zlib.

     --password    When extracting a password-encrypted ZIP archive, you must specify --password to
                   allow ditto to prompt for a password to use to extract the contents of the file.
                   If this option is not provided, and a password-encrypted file is encountered,
                   ditto will emit an error message.', 'osx');

     The DOS fdisk program can be used to divide space on the disk into parti-
     tions and set one active.  This fdisk program serves a similar purpose to
     the DOS program.  When called with no special flags, it prints the MBR
     partition table of the specified device, i.e.,

   # fdisk fd0
   Disk: fd0   geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
   Offset: 0   Signature: 0xAA55
      Starting    Ending
    #: id   cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd  sec [start - size]

    4: 00     0   0   0 -    0   0    0 [   0 -     0] unused

     The geometry displayed is a synthetic geometry unless another geometry
     has been selected using the -c, -h, and -s options.  In the future, fdisk
     will read the BIOS geometry from the IOKit registry.

     In this example, the disk is divided into two partitions that happen to
     fill the disk.  The first partition overlaps the third partition.  (Used
     for debugging purposes.)

     #     Number of partition table entry.  A `*\' denotes the
     bootable partition.

     id     System identifier.  OpenBSD reserves the magic number 166
     decimal (A6 in hex).  If no 166 partition is found, it will
     use an older FreeBSD partition (with a magic number of 165 or
     A5 in hex).

     cyl/hd/sec   These fields provide the starting and ending address of the
     partition in BIOS geometry

     start/size   These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors
     of the partition in linear block addresses.

     NOTE: The sectors field is `1 based\', and the start field is `0
     based\'.  The CHS values might need to be in the BIOS\'s geometry for older
     systems to be able to boot and use the drive correctly; most modern sys-
     tems prefer the starting sector and size in preference to the CHS values.

     The -i flag is used to indicate that the partition data is to be initial-
     ized.  In this mode, fdisk will completely overwrite the primary MBR and
     partition table, either using the default MBR template, or the one speci-
     fied by the -f flag.

     In the default template, partition number 1 will be configured as a Dar-
     win boot partition spanning from cylinder 0, head 1, sector 1, and
     extending for 8 megabytes.   Partition number 2 will be configured as a
     Darwin HFS partition spanning the rest of the disk.  This mode is
     designed to initialize an MBR the very first time, or when it has been
     corrupted beyond repair.

     You can specify other default partition styles with the -a flag.  The
     available styles are:

     boothfs   Creates an 8Mb boot partition (type AB hex) and makes the
     rest of the disk a Darwin HFS partition (type AF hex).

     bootufs   Creates an 8Mb boot partition (type AB hex) and makes the
     rest of the disk a Darwin UFS partition (type A8 hex).

     hfs   Makes the entire disk one Darwin UFS partition (type A8 hex).

     ufs   Makes the entire disk one HFS+ partition (type AF hex).

     dos   Makes the entire disk one DOS partition (type 0C hex).

     raid   Makes the entire disk one type AC hex partition.

     The -u flag is used to update the MBR code on a given drive.  The MBR
     code extends from offset 0x000 to the start of the partition table at
     offset 0x1BE.  It is similar to the -i flag, except the existing parti-
     tion table is preserved. This is useful for writing new MBR code onto an
     existing drive, and is equivalent to the DOS command `FDISK /MBR\'.
     Note that this option will overwrite the NT disk signature, if present.
     The -u and -i flags can not be specified together.

     The flag -e is used to modify a partition table using a interactive edit
     mode of the fdisk program.   This mode is designed to allow you to change
     any partition on the drive you choose, including extended partitions.  It
     is a very powerful mode, but is safe as long as you do not execute the
     write command, or answer in the negative (the default) when fdisk asks
     you about writing out changes.

COMMAND MODE

     When you first enter this mode, you are presented with a prompt, that
     looks like so: fdisk: 0>.  This prompt has two important pieces of infor-
     mation for you.  It will tell you if the in-memory copy of the boot block
     has been modified or not.  If it has been modified, the prompt will
     change to look like: fdisk:*0>.  The second piece of information pertains
     to the number given in the prompt.   This number specifies the disk offset
     of the currently selected boot block you are editing.  This number could
     be something different that zero when you are editing extended parti-
     tions.  The list of commands and their explanations are given below.

     help    Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the interactive
              edit mode.

     manual  Display this manual page.

     reinit  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the boot block.

     auto    Partition the disk with one of the automatic partition styles.

     disk    Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed.  You
             are given a chance to edit it if you wish.

     edit    Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current boot
             block.  You can edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in sector
             offsets and sizes.

     setpid  Change the partition identifier of the given partition table
             entry.  This command is particularly useful for reassigning an
             existing partition to OpenBSD.

     flag    Make the given partition table entry bootable.  Only one entry
             can be marked bootable.  If you wish to boot from an extended
             partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for
             the extended partition as bootable.

     update  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently
             selected boot block.  Note that this option will overwrite the NT
             disk signature, if present.

     select  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by the
             extended partition table entry in the current boot block.

     print   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot block and
             its MBR table to the terminal.

     write   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk.  You will be
             asked to confirm this operation.

     exit    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously
             selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
             program if there is none.

     quit    Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the previously
             selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
             program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified
             block out.

            input, use `-\' as a filename argument.

   -F, --separator separator
            Use the specified string as the separator between the  filename
            and the file result returned. Defaults to `:\'.

   -h, --no-dereference
            option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support
            symbolic links). This is the default  if  the  environment
            variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not defined.

   -I, --mime
            Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than
            the more traditional human  readable  ones.  For example:
            `text/plain;  charset=us-ascii\' rather  than `ASCII text\'.
            In order for this option to work, file changes the way it  han-
            dles  files  recognised  by the command itself (such as many of
            the text file types, directories etc),  and  makes  use  of  an
            alternative ``magic\'\' file.  (See ``FILES\'\' section, below).
   -i       If the file is a regular file do not classify its contents.

   -k, --keep-going
            Don\'t stop at the first match, keep going.

   -L, --dereference
            option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option
            in ls(1) (on systems that support symbolic links).  This is the
            default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.

   -m, --magic-file list
            Specify an alternate list of files  containing  magic  numbers.
            This  can be a single file, or a colon-separated list of files.
            If a compiled magic file is found alongside, it  will  be  used
            instead.   With  the  -I  or  --mime  option,  the program adds
            ".mime" to each file name.

   -m list Like -m, except the default rules are not applied.

   -n, --no-buffer
            Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file.   This  is
            only  useful if checking a list of files.  It is intended to be
            used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

   -d       Apply default system tests, this is the default if  neither  -m
            nor -M are supplied.

   -N, --no-pad
            Don\'t pad filenames so that they align in the output.

   -p, --preserve-date
            On systems that support utime(2) or utimes(2), attempt to pre-
            serve the access  time  of  files  analyzed,  to  pretend  that
            file(2) never read them.

   -r, --raw
            No  operation,  included  for  historical  compatability.

   -s, --special-files
            Normally, file only attempts to read and deter-
            mine the type of argument files which stat(2) reports are ordinary
            files.  This prevents problems,  because  reading  special
            files can have peculiar consequences.  Specifying the -s option
            causes file to also read argument  files  which  are  block  or
            character  special  files.   This is useful for determining the
            filesystem types of the data in raw disk partitions, which  are
            block special files.  This option also causes file to disregard
            the file size as reported by stat(2) since on some  systems  it
            reports a zero size for raw disk partitions.

   -v, --version
            Print the version of the program and exit.

   -z, --uncompress
            Try to look inside compressed files.

   --help  Print a help message and exit.', 'osx');

   -X  A modification to permit find to be safely used in conjunction
       with xargs.  If a file name contains any of the
       delimiting characters used by xargs(1), a diagnostic message is
       displayed on standard error, and the file is skipped.  The delim-
       iting characters include single (\' \' \') and double (\' " \')
       quotes, backslash (\'\\\'), space, tab and newline characters.

   -d  Causes find to perform a depth-first traversal,
       i.e., directories are visited in post-order and all entries in a
       directory will be acted on before the directory itself.  By
       default, find visits directories in pre-order, i.e., before their
       contents.  Note, the default is not a breadth-first traversal.

   -f  Specifies a file hierarchy for find to traverse.
       File hierarchies can also be specified as the operands immediately
       following the options.

   -s  Causes find to traverse the file hierarchies in lexicographical
       order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory.

   -l number
             Replace multiple spaces with tabs at the start of each output

Options
     -b     Use the block specified immediately after the flag as the
            super block for the filesystem.  Block 32 is usually an
            alternate super block.

     -f     Force fsck to check `clean\' filesystems when preening.

     -l     Limit the number of parallel checks to the number specified
            in the following argument.  By default, the limit is the num-
            ber of disks, running one process per disk.  If a smaller
            limit is given, the disks are checked round-robin, one
            filesystem at a time.

     -m     Use the mode specified in octal immediately after the flag as
            the permission bits to use when creating the lost+found
            directory rather than the default 1777.  In particular, systems
            that do not wish to have lost files accessible by all users on
            the system should use a more restrictive set of permissions
            such as 700.

     -p     Without the -p option, fsck audits and interactively repairs inconsistent
            conditions for filesystems.  If the filesystem is inconsistent the operator
            is prompted for concurrence before each correction is attempted.

            The -p option can result in some loss of data. 
            The amount and severity of data lost can be determined from the diagnostic output.
            The default action for each consistency correction is to wait for the
            operator to respond yes or no.  If the operator does not have
            write permission on the filesystem fsck will default to a -n action.

     -q     Do a quick check to determine if the filesystem was unmounted cleanly.

     -y     Assume a yes response to all questions asked by fsck; this
            should be used with great caution as this is a free license
            to continue after essentially unlimited trouble has been
            encountered.

     -n     Assume a no response to all questions asked by fsck except
            for `CONTINUE?\', which is assumed to be affirmative; do not
            open the filesystem for writing.

            In interactive mode, fsck will list the conversion to be made
            and ask whether the conversion should be done.   If a negative
            answer is given, no further operations are done on the
            filesystem.  In preen mode, the conversion is listed and done
            if possible without user interaction.  Conversion in preen
            mode is best used when all the filesystems are being con-
            verted at once.  The format of a filesystem can be determined
            from the first line of output from dumpfs(8).

            If no filesystems are given to fsck then a default list of filesystems is
            read from the file /etc/fstab.

     Inconsistencies checked are as follows:
     1.  Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free map.
     2.  Blocks claimed by an inode outside the range of the filesystem.
     3.  Incorrect link counts.
     4.  Size checks:
          Directory size not a multiple of DIRBLKSIZ.
          Partially truncated file.
     5.  Bad inode format.
     6.  Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
     7.  Directory checks:
          File pointing to unallocated inode.
          Inode number out of range.
          Dot or dot-dot not the first two entries of a directory
          or having the wrong inode number.
     8.  Super Block checks:
          More blocks for inodes than there are in the filesystem.
          Bad free block map format.
          Total free block and/or free inode count incorrect.

     Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are, with the
     operator\'s concurrence, reconnected by placing them in the lost+found

     directory.   The name assigned is the inode number.   If the lost+found
     directory does not exist, it is created.  If there is insufficient space
     its size is increased.

Options:

     address
             For the DARPA-Internet family, the address is either a host name present in the host name data
             base, hosts(5), or a DARPA Internet address expressed in the Internet standard \'dot
             notation\'.

             It is also possible to use the CIDR notation (also known as the slash notation) to include the
             netmask.  That is, one can specify an address like 192.168.0.1/16.

             For \'inet6\' family, it is also possible to specify the prefix length using the slash nota-tion, notation,
             tion, like ::1/128.  See the prefixlen parameter below for more information.

             The link-level (\'link\') address is specified as a series of colon-separated hex digits.  This
             can be used to e.g. set a new MAC address on an ethernet interface, though the mechanism used
             is not ethernet-specific.  If the interface is already up when this option is used, it will be
             briefly brought down and then brought back up again in order to ensure that the receive filter
             in the underlying ethernet hardware is properly reprogrammed.

     address_family
             The address family which affects interpretation of the remaining parameters.  Since an
             interface can receive transmissions in differing protocols with different naming schemes, specifying
             the address family is recommended.  The address or protocol families currently supported
             are \'inet\', \'inet6\', and \'link\'.  The default is \'inet\'.  \'ether\' and \'lladdr\' are
             synonyms for \'link\'.

     dest_address
             The address of the correspondent on the other end of a point to point link.

     interface
             This parameter is a string of the form \'name unit\', for example, \'en0\'.


The following parameters can be set with ifconfig:

     add     Another name for the alias parameter.  Introduced for compatibility with BSD/OS.

     alias   Establish an additional network address for this interface.  This is sometimes useful when
             changing network numbers, and one wishes to accept packets addressed to the old interface.  If
             the address is on the same subnet as the first network address for this interface, a non-conflicting
             netmask must be given.  Usually 0xffffffff is most appropriate.

     -alias  Remove the network address specified.  This would be used if you incorrectly specified an
             alias, or it was no longer needed.  If you have incorrectly set an NS address having the side
             effect of specifying the host portion, removing all NS addresses will allow you to respecify
             the host portion.

     anycast
             (Inet6 only.)  Specify that the address configured is an anycast address.  Based on the current
             specification, only routers can configure anycast addresses.  Anycast address will not be used
             as source address of any of outgoing IPv6 packets.

     arp     Enable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol (arp(4)) in mapping between network level
             addresses and link level addresses (default).  This is currently implemented for mapping
             between DARPA Internet addresses and IEEE 802 48-bit MAC addresses (Ethernet, FDDI, and Token
             Ring addresses).

     -arp    Disable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol (arp(4)).

     broadcast
             (Inet only.)  Specify the address to use to represent broadcasts to the network.  The default
             broadcast address is the address with a host part of all 1\'s.

     debug   Enable driver dependent debugging code; usually, this turns on extra console error logging.

     -debug  Disable driver dependent debugging code.

     delete  Another name for the -alias parameter.

     down    Mark an interface \'down\'.  When an interface is marked \'down\', the system will not attempt
             to transmit messages through that interface.  If possible, the interface will be reset to disable
             reception as well.  This action does not automatically disable routes using the interface.

     ether   Another name for the lladdr parameter.

     lladdr addr
             Set the link-level address on an interface.  This can be used to e.g. set a new MAC address on
             an ethernet interface, though the mechanism used is not ethernet-specific.  The address addr is
             specified as a series of colon-separated hex digits.  If the interface is already up when this
             option is used, it will be briefly brought down and then brought back up again in order to
             ensure that the receive filter in the underlying ethernet hardware is properly reprogrammed.

     media type
             If the driver supports the media selection system, set the media type of the interface to type.
             Some interfaces support the mutually exclusive use of one of several different physical media
             connectors.  For example, a 10Mb/s Ethernet interface might support the use of either AUI or
             twisted pair connectors.  Setting the media type to \'10base5/AUI\' would change the currently
             active connector to the AUI port.  Setting it to \'10baseT/UTP\' would activate twisted pair.
             Refer to the interfaces\' driver specific documentation or man page for a complete list of the
             available types.

     mediaopt opts
             If the driver supports the media selection system, set the specified media options on the
             interface.  The opts argument is a comma delimited list of options to apply to the interface.
             Refer to the interfaces\' driver specific man page for a complete list of available options.

     -mediaopt opts
             If the driver supports the media selection system, disable the specified media options on the
             interface.

     create  Create the specified network pseudo-device.  If the interface is given without a unit number,
             try to create a new device with an arbitrary unit number.  If creation of an arbitrary device
             is successful, the new device name is printed to standard output unless the interface is
             renamed or destroyed in the same ifconfig invocation.

     destroy
             Destroy the specified network pseudo-device.

     plumb   Another name for the create parameter.  Included for Solaris compatibility.

     unplumb
             Another name for the destroy parameter.  Included for Solaris compatibility.

     metric n
             Set the routing metric of the interface to n, default 0.  The routing metric is used by the
             routing protocol (routed(8)).  Higher metrics have the effect of making a route less favorable;
             metrics are counted as additional hops to the destination network or host.

     mtu n   Set the maximum transmission unit of the interface to n, default is interface specific.  The
             MTU is used to limit the size of packets that are transmitted on an interface.  Not all interfaces
             support setting the MTU, and some interfaces have range restrictions.

     netmask mask
             (Inet only.)  Specify how much of the address to reserve for subdividing networks into sub-networks.
             The mask includes the network part of the local address and the subnet part, which is
             taken from the host field of the address.  The mask can be specified as a single hexadecimal
             number with a leading `0x\', with a dot-notation Internet address, or with a pseudo-network name
             listed in the network table networks(5).  The mask contains 1\'s for the bit positions in the
             32-bit address which are to be used for the network and subnet parts, and 0\'s for the host
             part.  The mask should contain at least the standard network portion, and the subnet field
             should be contiguous with the network portion.

             The netmask can also be specified in CIDR notation after the address.  See the address option
             above for more information.

     prefixlen len
             (Inet6 only.)  Specify that len bits are reserved for subdividing networks into sub-networks.
             The len must be integer, and for syntactical reason it must be between 0 to 128.  It is almost
             always 64 under the current IPv6 assignment rule.  If the parameter is omitted, 64 is used.

             The prefix can also be specified using the slash notation after the address.  See the address
             option above for more information.

     remove  Another name for the -alias parameter.  Introduced for compatibility with BSD/OS.

     link[0-2]
             Enable special processing of the link level of the interface.  These three options are interface
             specific in actual effect, however, they are in general used to select special modes of
             operation.  An example of this is to enable SLIP compression, or to select the connector type
             for some Ethernet cards.  Refer to the man page for the specific driver for more information.

     -link[0-2]
             Disable special processing at the link level with the specified interface.

     -I    Display total statstics for a given time period, rather than aver-
           age statistics for each second during that time period.

     -K    In the blocks transferred display (-o), display block count in
           kilobytes rather then the device native block size.

     -n    Display up to devs number of devices.  iostat will display fewer
           devices if there aren\'t devs devices present.

     -o    Display old-style iostat device statistics.  Sectors per second,
           transfers per second, and miliseconds per seek are displayed.  If
           -I is specified, total blocks/sectors, total transfers, and
           miliseconds per seek are displayed.

     -T    Display TTY statistics.  This is on by default, unless -d is speci-
           fied.

     -U    Display system load averages.  This is on by default, unless -d is

     devices
           Device operations.  The header of the field is the device name and
           unit number.  iostat will display as many devices as will fit in a
           standard 80 column screen, or the maximum number of devices in the
           system, whichever is smaller.  If -n is specified on the command
           line, iostat will display the smaller of the requested number of
           devices, and the maximum number of devices in the system.  To force
           iostat to display specific drives, their names may be supplied on
           the command line.  iostat will not display more devices than will
           fit in an 80 column screen, unless the -n argument is given on the
           command line to specify a maximum number of devices to display, or
           the list of specified devices exceeds 80 columns.  If fewer devices
           are specified on the command line than will fit in an 80 column
           screen, iostat will show only the specified devices.

           The standard iostat device display shows the following statistics:

   -dominfo
             Displays a list of domains into which the software package can be installed.  For example: LocalSystem or
             CurrentUserHomeDirectory.  The domains listed are those which are available and enabled when the command is run.

   -volinfo
             Displays a list of volumes onto which the software package can be installed.
             The volumes listed are the mounted volumes available when the command is run.

   -pkginfo
             Displays a list of packages that can be installed onto the target volume.  If a metapackage is given as
             the package source, all of its subpackages are listed.

   -query flag
             Queries a package for information about the metadata.  See -help for supported flags.

   -allowUntrusted
             Allow install of a package signed by an untrusted (or expired) certificate.

   -dumplog
             Detailed log information is always sent to syslog using the LOG_INSTALL facility (and will wind up in
             /var/log/install.log).  -dumplog additionally writes this log to standard error output.

   -help     Display the help screen describing the list of parameters.

   -verbose  Display more descriptive information than the default output.
             Use this parameter in conjunction with -pkginfo and  -volinfo information requests to see more readable output.
             The default output is formatted for scripting.

   -verboseR Same information as -verbose except the output is formatted for easy parsing.

   -vers     Display the version of this command.

   -config   Format the command line installation arguments for later use.  The output is sent to stdout, but can be
             redirected to a file to create a configuration file.
             When specifying this option, an installation is not actually performed.  This configuration file can be supplied
             as the argument to the -file parameter instead of typing a long series of installation arguments.
             The config file can be used to perform multiple identical installs.
             Create a config file as follows:
             installer -pkg ~/Documents/Foo.pkg -target / -config > /tmp/configfile.plist

   -plist    Formats the installer output into an XML file, which is sent by default to stdout.
             Use this parameter for -dominfo, -volinfo, and -pkginfo

   -file pathToFile
             The path to the XML file containing parameter information in the key/value dictionary.
             This file can be used instead of the command line parameters, and supersedes any parameters on the
             command line.  When you type this parameter, you type the path to the XML file.
             Use with config file generated by -config For example:
             installer -file /tmp/configfile.plist

   -lang ISOLanguageCode
             Default language of installed system (ISO format).
             This is only necessary when performing a system (OS) install, otherwise is it ignored.
             There is no verification done to make sure that the language being set actually exists on the machine
             however the ISO language code is verified to ensure that it is valid.

   -listiso
             Display the list of valid ISO language codes the installer recognizes.

   -showChoiceChangesXML
             Print to stdout the install choices for the package (specified with -pkg) in an XML format.
             This allows choice attributes to be modified and applied at install-time using
             -applyChoiceChangesXML.  See CHOICE CHANGES FILE for details of this XML format.

   -applyChoiceChangesXML pathToXMLFile
             Applies the install choice changes specified in pathToXMLFile to the default choices in the package
             before installation. This allows the command-line installer to customize choice what gets installed.
             See CHOICE CHANGES FILE for details of this XML format.
             Any problems encountered while applying the choice changes will be reported to the LOG_INSTALL
             facility (i.e. to /var/log/install.log), and also to stdout if -dumplog is used.

   -showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML pathToXMLFile
             Applies the install choice changes specified in pathToXMLFile to the default choices in the package,
             and then dumps the resulting choice state to stdout.
             The input and output XML format is as described in CHOICE CHANGES FILE.  Since changing one choice
             in a package can implicitly change other choices, this option allows you to confirm that a particular
             choiceChanges file will have the intended effect. You must specify a -target when using this option,
             since the evaluated choices can also change with the state of the target disk.

   -showChoicesXML
             Print to stdout the install choices for the package (specified with -pkg) in a hierarchical XML format.
             This is not the same format as used with -applyChoiceChangesXML.
             This option is provided for System Image Utility only.

   -store    Install the product archive specified by -package, in the same way that it would be installed
             through the Mac App Store. In this mode, no other options are supported.
             (You can specify -target, but the only allowable value is the root volume mount point, /). 
             For best Mac App Store fidelity, run installer as an admin user (not using sudo); you will be prompted
             for your admin user\'s password before the install begins.

             This mode is provided for testing a product archive before submission to the Mac App Store.

    kext     Unload the loaded kext whose bundle identifier matches the
              CFBundleIdentifier of kext.  All instances of IOService sub-
              classes defined by the loaded kext and in the IOService plane of
              the I/O Registry are terminated; the kext is checked to make
              sure no instances of its libkern C++ classes remain; the kext\'s
              C++ static destructores and module stop routine are invoked;
              then the kext\'s executable and IOKitPersonalities are unloaded
              from the kernel.  Failure at any stage prevents kext unload.

     -b identifier, -bundle-id identifier
              Unload executable and IOKitPersonalities (as described immedi-
              ately above) for the kext whose CFBundleIdentifier is
              identifier.

     -c classname, -class classname
              Terminate all instances of class classname that are in the
              IOService plane of the I/O Registry, if possible, but do not
              unload the defining kext or its IOKitPersonalities.  New load
              requests for devices that were driven by these terminated
              instances may result in the same class being instantiated at any
              time.

     -h, -help
              Print a help message describing each option flag and exit with a
              success result, regardless of any other options on the command
              line.

     -m identifier
              Same as -b (remains for backward compatibility).

     -p, -personalities-only
              Terminate services and remove personalities only; do not unload
              kexts.

     -q, -quiet
              Quiet mode; print no informational or error messages.

     -v [0-6 | 0x####], -verbose [0-6 | 0x####]
              Verbose mode; print information about program operation.  Higher
              levels of verbosity include all lower levels.  By default
              kextunload prints only warnings and errors.  You can specify a
              level from 0-6, or a hexadecimal log specification (as described
              in kext_logging(8)). The levels of verbose output are:

              0            Print only errors (that is, suppress warnings); see
                           also -quiet.

              1 (or none)  Print basic information about program operation.

              2            Prints information about unload stages.

              3            Prints information about removal of personalities.

              4            Prints information about module stop functions and
                           C++ class destruction.

              5            Prints detailed information internal operations
                           such as bookkeping.

Options
     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes.

     -1      (The numeric digit \'one\'.)  Force output to be one entry per line.
              This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

     -A      List all entries including those starting with a dot .
             Except for . and ..
             This option is always set for the superuser (via sudo).

     -a      List all entries including those starting with a dot .

     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by
             ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \\xxx,
             where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.

     -b      As -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible.

     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
             a terminal.

     -c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting or printing.

     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

     -D format
             When printing in the long (-l) format, use format to format the date and time output.
             The argument format is a string used by strftime(3).
             Depending on the choice of format string, this may result in a different number of columns
             in the output.  This option overrides the -T option. This option is not defined in POSIX.1.

     -F      Display a slash / immediately after each pathname that is a directory,
             an asterisk * after each that is executable, an at sign @ after each symbolic link,
             an equals sign = after each socket, a percent sign % after each whiteout,
             and a vertical bar | after each that is a FIFO.

     -f      Output is not sorted.

     -G      Enable colour output.
             This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR or COLORTERM in the environment and setting             --color=auto. (See below.)

     -g      This option is deprecated. This option is only available for compatibility
             with POSIX; it is used to display the group name in the long (-l) format output
             (the owner name is suppressed).

     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.
             This option is assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l options are specified.

     -h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte,
             Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to three or less
             using base 2 for sizes.

     -i      For each file, print the file\'s file serial number (inode number).

     -k      If the -s option is specified, print the file size allocation in
             kilobytes, not blocks.  This option overrides the environment
             variable BLOCKSIZE.

     -L      If argument is a symbolic link, list the file or directory the
             link references rather than the link itself.  This option cancels
             the -P option.

     -l      List in long format. Ownership, Date/Time etc (See below)
             For terminal output, a total sum of all the file sizes is 
             output on a line before the long listing.
             If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is
             preceded by ->

     -m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.

     -n      Display user and group IDs numerically rather than converting to
             a user or group name in a long (-l) output. This option turns on the -l option.

     -O      Include the file flags in a long (-l) output.

     -o      List in long format, but omit the group id.

     -P      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than
             the object the link references.  This option cancels the -H and
            -L options.

     -p      Write a slash (/) after each filename if that file is a directory.

     -q      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the
             character `?\'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     -r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical
             order or the oldest entries first.
             (or largest files last, if combined with sort by size)

     -S      Sort files by size

     -s      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each
             file, in units of 512 bytes, where partial units are rounded up
             to the next integer value.   If the output is to a terminal, a
             total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the
             listing.  The environment variable BLOCKSIZE overrides the unit
             size of 512 bytes.

     -T      When used with the -l (lowercase letter ``ell\'\') option, display
             complete time information for the file, including month, day,
             hour, minute, second, and year.

     -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before
             sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

     -u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file
             for sorting (-t) or printing (-l).

     -v      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters.             This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

     -W      Display whiteouts when scanning directories. (-S) flag).

     -w      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.

      launchctl [subcommand [arguments ...]]

SPECIFIERS (Target domain/service)
Many subcommands in launchctl take a specifier which indicates the target
domain or service for the subcommand.

This specifier may take one of the following forms:

     system/[service-name]
              Targets the system domain or a service within the system domain.
              The system domain manages the root Mach bootstrap and is considered a privileged
              execution context. Anyone may read or query the system domain,  but root
              privileges are required to make modifications.
             

     user/uid/[service-name]
              Targets the user domain for the given UID or a service within that domain.
              A user domain may exist independently of a logged-in user.
              User domains do not exist on iOS.

     login/asid/[service-name]
              Targets a user-login domain or service within that domain. A user-login domain
              is created when the user logs in at the GUI and is identified by the audit
              session identifier associated with that login.
              If a user domain has an associated login domain, the print subcommand will
              display the ASID of that login domain. User-login domains do not exist on iOS.

     gui/uid/[service-name]
              Another form of the login specifier. Rather than specifying a user-login
              domain by its ASID, this specifier targets the domain based on which user
              it is associated with and is generally more convenient.

              To discover a user’s UID, run the command: id -u username
              where username is the full user account name.

              Note: GUI domains and user domains share many resources. For the purposes of
              the Mach bootstrap name lookups, they are "flat", so they share the
              same set of registered names. But they still have discrete sets of services.
              So when printing the user domain\'s contents, you may see many Mach bootstrap
              name registrations from services that exist in the GUI domain for that user,
              but you will not see the services themselves in that list.

     session/asid/[service-name]
              Targets the session domain for the given audit session ID or a service within
              that domain. For more information about audit sessions, see auditon(2) and libbsm(3)

     pid/pid/[service-name]
              Targets the domain for the given PID or a service within that domain.
              Each process on the system will have a PID domain associated with it that consists of
              the XPC services visible to that  process which can be reached with xpc_connection_create(3).

SUBCOMMANDS

     bootstrap domain-target [service-path service-path2 ...] | service-target

              Bootstrap a domain/service (equivalent to Load in the legacy syntax).
              Services may be specified as a series of paths or a service identifier.

              Paths may point to XPC service bundles, launchd.plist(5) s, or a directory(s)
              containing a collection of either.
              If there were one or more errors while bootstrapping or removing a collection of
              services, the problematic paths will be printed with the errors that occurred.

              If no paths or service target are specified, this commands will bootstrap a domain
              specified as a domain target.
              Some domains will implicitly bootstrap pre-defined paths as part of their creation.

     bootout domain-target [service-path service-path2 ...] | service-target

              Remove domain/service (equivalent to unload in the legacy syntax).
              Services may be specified as a series of paths or a service identifier.

              Paths may point to XPC service bundles, launchd.plist(5) s, or a directory(s) containing
              a collection of either.
              If there were one or more errors while bootstrapping or removing a collection of
              services, the problematic paths will be printed with the errors that occurred.

              If no paths or service target are specified, this commands willremove a domain
              specified as a domain target.

     enable service-target
              Enable the service in the requested domain. This subcommand may only
              target services within the system domain or user and user-login domains.

     disable service-target
              Disable the service in the requested domain. Once a service is disabled, it cannot
              be loaded in the specified domain until it is once again enabled.
              This state persists across boots of the device.
              This subcommand may only target services within the system domain or user and user-login domains.

     uncache service-name
              This subcommand instructs launchd to bypass its service cache for the named service
              and instead read the service\'s configuration file directly from disk.
              launchd maintains an in-memory cache of XPC service configuration files to minimize
              the disk I/O. This subcommand will remove a cached entry so that developers may more
              rapidly iterate on a service\'s configuration.
              It should not ever be used as part of production workflow.

     kickstart [-kp] service-target
              Instructs launchd to kickstart the specified service.

              -k       If the service is already running, kill the running
                       instance before restarting the service.

              -p       Upon success, print the PID of the new process or the
                       already-running process to stdout.

     attach [-ksx] service-target
              Attaches the system\'s debugger to the process currently backing the specified service.
              By default, if the service is not running, this subcommand will block until the service starts.

              -k       If the service is already running, kill the running instance.

              -s       Force the service to start.

              -x       Attach to xpcproxy(3) before it execs and becomes the service process.
                       This flag is generally not useful for anyone but the launchd maintainer.

     debug service-target [--program program path] [--guard-malloc]
              [--malloc-stack-logging] [--debug-libraries]
              [--introspection-libraries] [--NSZombie] [--32] [--stdin]
              [--stdout] [--stderr] [--environment] [--] [argv0 argv1 argv2
              ...]
              Configures the next invocation of a service for debugging. This subcommand allows
              you to temporarily replace the main executable  of the service with one at
              a different path, enable libgmalloc(3), set environment variables, set the argument
              vector and more.
              This is a convenient alternative to editing the launchd.plist(5) for the service and
              then reloading it, as the additional debugging properties are cleared once the service has
              run once with them.

              --program program-path
                       Instructs launchd(8) to use program-path as the  service\'s executable.

              --guard-malloc
                       Turns on libgmalloc(3) for the service.

              --malloc-stack-logging
                       Turns on malloc(3) stack logging for the service.

              --malloc-nano-allocator
                       Turns on the malloc(3) nano allocator for the service.

              --debug-libraries
                       Sets the DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX for the service to "_debug",  which prefers the debug variants
                       of libraries if they exist. See dyld(1) for more information.

              --introspection-libraries
                       Adds /usr/lib/system/introspection to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
                       for the service. This causes the system to prefer the introspection
                       variants of libraries if they exist.

              --NSZombie
                       Enables NSZombie.

              --32     Runs the service in the appropriate 32-bit architecture.
                       Only available on 64-bit platforms.

              --stdin [stdin-path]
                       Sets the service\'s standard input to be stdin-path.  If no file is given,
                       uses the current terminal as the service\'s standard input.
                       If stdin-path does not exist, it is created.

              --stdout [stdout-path]
                       Sets the service\'s standard input to be stdout-path.
                       If no file is given, uses the current terminal as the service\'s standard input.
                       If stdout-path does not exist, it is created.

              --stderr [stderr-path]
                       Sets the service\'s standard input to be stderr-path.
                       If no file is given, uses the current terminal as the service\'s standard input.
                       If stderr-path does not exist, it is created.

              --environment VARIABLE0=value VARIABLE1=value ...
                       Set the given environment variables on the service.

              -- argv0 argv1 ...
                       Any arguments following the -- are given to the service
                       as its argument vector.

                       IMPORTANT: These arguments replace the service\'s
                       default argument vector; they are not merged in any
                       way. The first argument following -- is given as the
                       initial (zeroth) element of the service\'s argument vec-
                       tor. As with the ProgramArguments launchd.plist(5) key,
                       you should read carefully and understand the execve(2)
                       man page.

     kill signal-name | signal-number service-target
              Sends the specified signal to the specified service if it is running.
              The signal number or name (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, etc.) may be specified.

     blame service-target
              If the service is running, prints a human-readable string describing why launchd
              launched the service. Note that services may run for many reasons; this subcommand
              will only show the most proximate reason. So if a service was run due to a timer
              firing, this subcommand will print that reason, irrespective of  whether there
              were messages waiting on the service\'s various  endpoints.
              This subcommand is only intended for debugging and profiling use and its
              output should not be relied upon in production scenarios.

     print domain-target | service-target
              Prints information about the specified service or domain. Domain output
              includes various properties about the domain as well as a list of services
              and endpoints in the domain with state pertaining to each.
              Service output includes various properties of the service, including
              information about its origin on-disk, its current state,
              execution context, and last exit status.

              IMPORTANT: This output is NOT API in any sense at all. Do NOT
              rely on the structure or information emitted for ANY reason. It
              may change from release to release without warning.

     print-cache
              Prints the contents of the launchd service cache.

     print-disabled
              Prints the list of disabled services.

     plist [segment,section] Mach-O
              Prints the the property list embedded in the __TEXT,__info_plist
              segment/section of the target Mach-O or the specified seg-
              ment/section.

     procinfo pid
              Prints information about the execution context of the specified
              PID. This information includes Mach task-special ports and
              exception ports (and when run against a DEVELOPMENT launchd,
              what names the ports are advertised as in the Mach bootstrap
              namespace, if they are known to launchd) and audit session context.
              This subcommand is intended for diagnostic purposes only,
              and its output should not be relied upon in production scenarios.
              This command requires root privileges.

     hostinfo
              Prints information about the system\'s host-special ports,
              including the host-exception port. This subcommand requires root privileges.

     resolveport owner-pid port-name
              Given a PID and the name of a Mach port right in that process\' port namespace,
              resolves that port to an endpoint name known to launchd.
              This subcommand requires root privileges.

     examine [tool arg0 arg1 @PID ...]
              Causes launchd to fork(2) itself for examination by a profiling tool and 
              prints the PID of this new instance to stdout. You are responsible for killing
              this snapshot when it is no longer needed.

              Many profiling tools cannot safely examine launchd because they depend on the
              functionality it provides. This subcommand creates an effective snapshot
              of launchd that can be examined independently.
              Note that on Darwin platforms, fork(2) is implemented such that only
              the thread which called fork(2) is replicated into the new child
              process, so this subcommand is not useful for  examining any thread
              other than the main event loop.

              This subcommand takes an optional invocation of a tool to be  used on the
              launchd snapshot. Where you would normally give the PID of the process
              to be examined in the tool\'s invocation, instead specify the argument
              "@PID", and launchctl will substi  tute that argument with the PID
              of the launchd snapshot in its subsequent execution of the tool.
              If used in this form, launchctl will automatically kill the snapshot
              instance when the examination tool exits.

              This subcommand may only be used against a DEVELOPMENT launchd.

     config system | user parameter value
              Sets persistent configuration information for launchd(8)
              domains. Only the system domain and user domains may be configured.
              The location of the persistent storage is an implementation detail,
              and changes to that storage should only be made through this subcommand.
              A reboot is required for changes made through this subcommand to take effect.

              Supported configuration parameters are:

              umask    Sets the umask(2) for services within the target domain
                       to the value specified by value.  Note that this value
                       is parsed by strtoul(3) as an octal-encoded number, so
                       there is no need to prefix it with a leading \'0\'.

              path     Sets the PATH environment variable for all services
                       within the target domain to the string value.  The
                       string value should conform to the format outlined for
                       the PATH environment variable in environ(7).  Note that
                       if a service specifies its own PATH, the service-spe-
                       cific environment variable will take precedence.

                       NOTE: This facility cannot be used to set general envi-
                       ronment variables for all services within the domain.
                       It is intentionally scoped to the PATH environment
                       variable and nothing else for security reasons.

     reboot [system|userspace|halt|logout|apps|reroot mount-point]
              Instructs launchd to begin tearing down userspace. With no argument
              given or with the system argument given, launchd will make
              the reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely
              torn down. With the halt argument given, launchd will make the
              reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely torn
              down and pass the RB_HALT flag, halting the system and not initiating
              a reboot.

              With the userspace argument given, launchd will re-exec itself
              when userspace has been torn down and bring userspace back up.
              This is useful for rebooting the system quickly under conditions
              where kernel data structures or hardware do not need to be reinitialized.

              With the reroot argument given, launchd will perform a userspace
              shutdown as with the userspace argument, but it will exec a copy
              of launchd from the specified mount-point.  This mechanism is a
              light-weight way of changing boot partitions. As part of this
              process, launchd will make mount-point the new root partition
              and bring userspace up as if the kernel had designated
              mount-point as the root partition.

              IMPORTANT: This type of reboot will, in no way, affect the
              already-running kernel on the host. Therefore, when using this
              option to switch to another volume, you should only target vol-
              umes whose userspace stacks are compatible with the already-run-
              ning kernel.

              NOTE: As of the date of this writing, this option does not com-
              pletely work.

              With the logout argument given, launchd will tear down the
              caller\'s GUI login session in a manner similar to a logout ini-
              tiated from the Apple menu. The key difference is that a logout
              initiated through this subcommand will be much faster since it
              will not give apps a chance to display modal dialogs to block
              logout indefinitely; therefore there is data corruption risk to
              using this option. Only use it when you know you have no unsaved
              data in your running apps.

              With the apps argument given, launchd will terminate all apps
              running in the caller\'s GUI login session that did not come from
              a launchd.plist(5) on-disk. Apps like Finder, Dock and Syste-
              mUIServer will be unaffected. Apps are terminated in the same
              manner as the logout argument, and all the same caveats apply.

              -s       When rebooting the machine (either a full reboot or
                       userspace reboot), brings the subsequent boot session
                       up in single-user mode.

     error [posix|mach|bootstrap] code
              Prints a human-readable string of the given error code.  By
              default, launchctl will attempt to guess which error domain the
              code given belongs to. The caller may optionally specify which
              domain (either posix, mach, or bootstrap) to interpret the given
              code as an error from that subsystem.

     variant  Prints the launchd variant currently active on the system. Pos-
              sible variants include RELEASE, DEVELOPMENT and DEBUG.

     version  Prints the launchd version string.

MORE SUBCOMMANDS

     Subcommands from the previous implementation of launchd are generally
     available, though some may be unimplemented. Unimplemented subcommands
     are documented as such.

     load | unload [-wF] [-S sessiontype] [-D searchpath] paths ...
              Load the specified configuration files or directories of
              configuration files.  Jobs that are not on-demand will be started
              as soon as possible. All specified jobs will be loaded before any
              of them are allowed to start. Note that per-user configuration
              files (LaunchAgents) must be owned by root (if they are located
              in /Library/LaunchAgents) or the user loading them (if they are
              located in $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents).  All system-wide daemons
              (LaunchDaemons) must be owned by root. Configuration files must
              disallow group and world writes. These restrictions are in place
              for security reasons, as allowing writability to a launchd
              configuration file allows one to specify which executable will be
              launched.

              Note that allowing non-root write access to the
              /System/Library/LaunchDaemons directory WILL render your system
              unbootable.

              -w       Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false or true
                       for the load and unload subcommands respectively.
                       In previous versions, this option would modify the configuration file.
                       Now the state of the Disabled key is stored elsewhere on- disk
                       in a location that may not be directly manipulated by any
                       process other than launchd.

              -F       Force the loading or unloading of the plist. Ignore the Disabled key.

              -S sessiontype
                       Some jobs only make sense in certain contexts. This
                       flag instructs launchctl to look for jobs in a differ-
                       ent location when using the -D flag, and allows
                       launchctl to restrict which jobs are loaded into which
                       session types. Sessions are only relevant for per-user
                       launchd contexts. Relevant sessions are Aqua (the
                       default), Background and LoginWindow.  Background
                       agents may be loaded independently of a GUI login. Aqua
                       agents are loaded only when a user has logged in at the
                       GUI. LoginWindow agents are loaded when the LoginWindow
                       UI is displaying and currently run as root.

              -D searchpath
                       Load or unload all plist(5) files in the search path  given.
                       This option may be thought of as expanding into many
                       individual paths depending on the search path given.
                       Valid search paths include "system," "local,"  and "all."
                       When providing a session type, an additional search path
                       is available for use called "user." For example, 
                       without a session type given, "-D system" would load from
                       or unload all property list files from
                       /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.  With a session type
                       passed, it would load from
                       /System/Library/LaunchAgents.  Note that launchctl no
                       longer respects the network search path.

                       In a previous version of launchd, these search paths
                       were called "domains", hence -D. The word "domain" is
                       now used for a totally different concept.

              NOTE: Due to bugs in the previous implementation and long-stand-
              ing client expectations around those bugs, the load and unload
              subcommands will only return a non-zero exit code due to
              improper usage.  Otherwise, zero is always returned.

     submit -l label [-p executable] [-o stdout-path] [-e stderr-path] --
              command [arg0] [arg1] [...]
              A simple way of submitting a program to run without a configuration
              file. This mechanism also tells launchd to keep the program alive in the event
              of failure.

              -l label
                       What unique label to assign this job to launchd.

              -p program
                       What program to really execute, regardless of what follows
                       the -- in the submit sub-command.

              -o stdout-path
                       Where to send the stdout of the program.

              -e stderr-path
                       Where to send the stderr of the program.

     remove label
              Remove the job from launchd by label. This subcommand will
              return immediately and not block until the job has been stopped.

     start label
              Start the specified job by label. The expected use of this sub-
              command is for debugging and testing so that one can manually
              kick-start an on-demand server.

     stop label
              Stop the specified job by label. If a job is on-demand, launchd
              may immediately restart the job if launchd finds any criteria
              that is satisfied.

     list [-x] [label]
              With no arguments, list all of the jobs loaded into launchd in
              three columns. The first column displays the PID of the job if
              it is running.  The second column displays the last exit status
              of the job. If the number in this column is negative, it repre-
              sents the negative of the signal which stopped the job. Thus,
              "-15" would indicate that the job was terminated with SIGTERM.
              The third column is the job\'s label. If [label] is specified,
              prints information about the requested job.

              -x       This flag is no longer supported.

     setenv key value
              Specify an environment variable to be set on all future pro-
              cesses launched by launchd in the caller\'s context.

     unsetenv key
              Specify that an environment variable no longer be set on any
              future processes launched by launchd in the caller\'s context.

     getenv key
              Print the value of an environment variable that launchd would
              set for all processes launched into the caller\'s context.

     export   Export all of the environment variables of launchd for use in a
              shell eval statement.

     getrusage self | children
              Get the resource utilization statistics for launchd or the children
              of launchd.  This subcommand is not implemented.

     log [level loglevel] [only | mask loglevels...]
              Get and set the syslog(3) log level mask. The available log levels
              are: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert
              and emergency. This subcommand is not implemented.

     limit [cpu | filesize | data | stack | core | rss | memlock | maxproc |
              maxfiles] [both [soft | hard]]
              With no arguments, this command prints all the resource limits
              of launchd as found via getrlimit(2).  When a given resource is
              specified, it prints the limits for that resource. With a third
              argument, it sets both the hard and soft limits to that value.
              With four arguments, the third and forth argument represent the
              soft and hard limits respectively.  See setrlimit(2).

     shutdown
              Tell launchd to prepare for shutdown by removing all jobs. This
              subcommand is not implemented.

     umask [newmask]
              Get or optionally set the umask(2) of launchd.  This subcommand
              is not implemented.

     bslist [PID | ..] [-j]
              This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the print subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     bsexec PID command [args]
              This executes the given command in as similar an execution con-
              text as possible to the target PID. Adopted attributes include
              the Mach bootstrap namespace, exception server and security
              audit session. It does not modify the process\' credentials (UID,
              GID, etc.) or adopt any environment variables from the target
              process. It affects only the Mach bootstrap context and
              directly-related attributes.

     asuser UID command [args]
              This executes the given command in as similar an execution con-
              text as possible to that of the target user\'s bootstrap. Adopted
              attributes include the Mach bootstrap namespace, exception
              server and security audit session. It does not modify the
              process\' credentials (UID, GID, etc.) or adopt any user-specific
              environment variables. It affects only the Mach bootstrap con-
              text and directly- related attributes.

     bstree   This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the print subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     managerpid
              This prints the PID of the launchd which manages the current
              bootstrap. In prior implementations, there could be multiple
              launchd processes each managing their own Mach bootstrap sub-
              sets. In the current implementation, all bootstraps are managed
              by one process, so this subcommand will always print "1".

     manageruid
              This prints the UID associated with the caller\'s launchd con-
              text.

     managername
              This prints the name of the launchd job manager which manages
              the current launchd context. See LimitLoadToSessionType in

          Display a detailed list of the architecture types in the input universal file.
          Lists universal header info. for each architecture in the file.

   -arch arch_type input_file
          Tell  lipo  that  input_file  contains  the specified architecture type. 
          This is unnecessary if input_file is an object file, a universal file,
          or some other file whose architecture(s) lipo can figure out.

   -arch_blank arch_type
          The output for the specified arch_type will be an MH_DYLIB_STUB file.
          This flag can not be used with any operation other than -create.

   -output output_file
          The output file.

   -create
          Create one universal output file from the input file(s).

   -thin arch_type
          Take one input file and create a thin output file with the specified arch_type.

   -replace arch_type file_name
          Take one universal input file; in the output file, replace the arch_type contents 
          of the input file with the contents of the specified file_name.

   -remove arch_type
          Take  one  universal input file and remove the arch_type from that universal file, 
          placing the result in the output file.

   -extract arch_type
          Take one universal input file and copy the arch_type from that universal file into 
          a universal output file containing only that architecture.

   -extract_family arch_type
          Take one universal input file and copy all of the arch_types for the family that
          arch_type is in from that universal file into an output file containing only those
          architectures.  If only one architecture is found the file will be thin.

   -verify_arch arch_type ...
          Take one input file and verify the specified arch_types are present in the file. 
          If so then exit with a status of 0 else exit with a status of 1.

   -segalign arch_type value
          Set the segment alignment of the specified arch_type when creating a universal file 
          containing that  architecture.   value is a hexadecimal number that must be an 
          integral power of 2.  This is only needed when lipo can\'t figure out the alignment 
          of an input  file  (currently  not  an object  file),  or when it guesses at the
          alignment too conservatively.  The default for files unknown to lipo is 0
          (2^0, or an alignment of one byte), and the  default  alignment  for  archives 
          is 4 (2^2, or 4-byte alignment).

   -E   Force encryption when connecting to the server.

   -U username
        Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.

   -c   This  option is provided for backwards-compatibility only. On systems that support it, this option forces
        the print file to be copied to the spool directory before printing.  In CUPS, print files are always sent
        to the scheduler via IPP which has the  same effect.

   -d destination
        Print files to the named printer.

   -t "name"
        Sets the job name.

   -H hh:mm 
   -H hold
   -H immediate
   -H restart
   -H resume
        Specifies when the job should be printed.  A value of immediate will print the file immediately, a value
        of hold will hold the job indefinitely, and a UTC time value (HH:MM) will hold the job until the specified
        UTC (not local) time. Use a value of resume with the -i option to resume a held job.  Use a value of restart
        with the -i option to restart a completed job.

   -P page-list
        Specifies which pages to print in the document. The list can contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#)
        separated by commas, e.g., "1,3-5,16". The page numbers refer to the output pages and not the document\'s
        original  pages - options like  "number-up" can affect the numbering of the pages.

Options
   -? -h Display help text.

   -a    Causes the list selection options to be ANDed.

   -A A  Specify A as an alternate name list file where the kernel
         addresses of the dynamic modules might be found.
         This option is available on systems whose AFS kernel 
         code is implemented via dynamic modules.

   -b    This option causes lsof to avoid kernel functions that might
         block - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).
         See the full lsof man page for more on using this option.

   -c c  This option selects the listing of files for processes executing
         the command that begins with the characters of c.
         Multiple commands can be specified, using multiple -c options.
         They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in
         AND option selection.

         If c begins and ends with a slash (\'/\'), the characters
         between the slashes is interpreted as a regular expression.
         Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted
         to prevent their interpretation by the shell. The closing
         slash can be followed by these modifiers:

          b   the regular expression is a basic one.
          i   ignore the case of letters.
          x   the regular expression is an extended one (default).

          See the lsof FAQ for more

   +c w  This option defines the maximum number of initial characters
         of the name of the UNIX command associated with a process to
         be printed in the COMMAND column. (The default is nine.)

         If w is zero (\'0\'), all command characters will be printed.

         If w is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND\'\',
         it will be raised to that length.

  -C     This option disables the reporting of any path name components
         from the kernel\'s name cache. See the KERNEL NAME CACHE section
         for more information.

  +d s   This option causes lsof to search for all open instances
         of directory s and the files and directories it contains at its
         top level. This option does NOT descend the directory tree,
         rooted at s, nor does it follow symbolic links within it. The
         +D D option can be used to request a full-descent directory
         tree search, rooted at directory D.

         Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to
         searching for files that the user has permission to examine
         with the system stat(2) function.

  -d s   This option specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to
         exclude from or include in the output listing.  The file
         descriptors are specified in the comma-separated set s - e.g.,
         `cwd,1,3\', `^6,^2\'. (There should be no spaces in the set.)

         The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set begin
         with \'^\'. It is an inclusion list if no entry begins with
         \'^\'.  Mixed lists are not permitted.

         A file descriptor number range can be in the set as long as
         neither member is empty, both members are numbers, and the
         ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g., `0-7\'
         or `3-10\'. Ranges can be specified for exclusion if they
         have the \'^\' prefix - e.g., ``^0-7\'\' excludes all file
         descriptors 0 through 7.

         Multiple file descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed
         set before participating in AND option selection.

         When there are exclusion and inclusion members in the set,
         lsof reports them as errors and exits with a non-zero return code.

         See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output values in
         the OUTPUT section for more information on file descriptor names.

   +D D  This option causes lsof to search for all open instances of
         directory D and all the files and directories it contains to
         its complete depth. Symbolic links within directory D are
         ignored - i.e, not followed.

   -D D  This option directs lsof\'s use of the device cache file.  The
         use of this option is sometimes restricted. See the DEVICE
         CACHE FILE section and the sections that follow it for more
         information on this option.

   -D    must be followed by a function letter; the function letter
         can optionally be followed by a path name.  Lsof recognizes
         these function letters:

          ? - report device cache file paths
          b - build the device cache file
          i - ignore the device cache file
          r - read the device cache file
          u - read and update the device cache file

         The  b,  r, and u functions, accompanied by a path name, are
         sometimes restricted. When these functions are restricted,
         they will not appear in the description of the -D option that
         accompanies -h or -? option output. See the full man page.

   +|-f [cfgGn]
         f by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be interpreted.
         When followed by c, f, g, G, or n in any combination
         it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information is
         to be enabled (`+\') or inhibited (`-\').

         Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system name if it matches
         a mounted-on directory name reported by mount(8), or if it represents a block
         device, named in the mount output and associated with a mounted directory name.
         When +f is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to  be file system
         names, and lsof will complain if any are not.  This can be useful, for example,
         when the file system name (mounted-on device) isn\'t a block device.
         This happens for some CD-ROM file systems.

         When -f is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to be simple files.
         Thus, for example, the -f / arguments direct lsof to search for open files
         with a / path name, not all open files in the / (root) file system.

         Be careful to make sure +f is properly terminated and isn\'t followed by a
         character (e.g., of the file or file system name) that might be taken as a parameter.
         For example, use `--\' after +f as in this example.

            $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name

         The listing of information from kernel file structures, requested with the +f [cfgGn] option
         form, is normally inhibited, and is not available for some dialects - e.g.,
         /proc-based Linux. When the prefix to f is a plus sign (`+\'), these characters
         request file structure information:

          c   file structure use count
          f   file structure address
          g   file flag abbreviations
          G   file flags in hexadecimal
          n   file structure node address

         When the prefix is minus (`-\') the same characters disable the listing of the indicated values.

         File structure addresses, use counts, flags, and node addresses can be used
         to detect more readily identical files inherited by child processes and
         identical files in use by different processes. Lsof column output can
         be sorted by output columns holding the values and listed to identify
         identical file use, or lsof field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl
         post-filter script, or by a C program.

   -F f  This option specifies a character list, f, that selects the fields to be output
         for processing by another program, and the character that terminates each
         output field. Each field to be output is specified with a single character in f.
         The field terminator defaults to NL, but can be changed to NUL (000).
         See the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for a description of the field identification
         characters and the field output process.

         When the field selection character list is empty, all fields are selected (except the
         raw device field for compatibility reasons) and the NL field terminator is used.

         When the field selection character list contains only a zero (`0\'), all fields are
         selected (except the raw device field for compatibility reasons) and the NUL
         terminator character is used.

         Other combinations of fields and their associated field terminator character must
         be set with explicit entries in f, as described in the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section.

         When a field selection character identifies an item lsof does not normally list
          - e.g., PPID, selected with -R - specification of the field character
          - e.g., ``-FR\'\' - also selects the listing of the item.

         When the field selection character list contains the single character `?\', lsof will
         display a help list of the field identification characters.
         (Escape the `?\' character as your  shell requires.)

   -g [s]
         This option selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process
         group IDentification (PGID) numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., `123\' or `123,456\'.
         (There should be no spaces in the set.)

         Multiple PGID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating
         in AND option selection.

         The -g option also enables the output display of PGID numbers.
         When specified without a PGID set that\'s all it does.

   -i [i] This option selects the listing of files any of whose Internet
         address matches the address specified in i. If no address is
         specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and
         x.25 (HP-UX) network files.

         If -i4 or -i6 is specified with no following address, only
         files of the indicated IP version, IPv4 or IPv6, are displayed.

         Multiple addresses can be specified with multiple -i options.

         An Internet address is specified in the form:

         [46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]

         where:
         46 specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6 that applies to the following address.
            \'6\' can be be specified only if the UNIX dialect supports IPv6.
            If neither \'4\' nor \'6\' is specified, the following address applies to all IP versions.
         protocol is a protocol name - TCP or UDP.
         hostname is an Internet host name. 
            Unless a specific IP version is specified, open network files
            associated with host names of all versions will be selected.
         hostaddr is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in dot form;
            or an IPv6 numeric address in colon form, enclosed in brackets,
            if the UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP version is
            selected, only its numeric addresses can be specified.
         service is an /etc/services name
         - e.g., smtp -
         or a list of them.
         port is a port number, or a list of them.

         At least one address component - 4, 6, protocol, ,IR hostname
         , hostaddr, or service - must be supplied.

         Some sample addresses:

       -i6               - IPv6 only
       TCP:25            - TCP and port 25
       @1.2.3.4          - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4
       @[3ffe:1e<file_system>bc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address 3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234
       UDP:who           - UDP who service port
       TCP@lsof.itap:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap
       tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10, service name smtp, port 99, host name foo   
       tcp@bar:smtp-nameserver - TCP, ports smtp through nameserver, host bar 
       :time             - either TCP or UDP time service port

   -k k  This option specifies a kernel name list file, k, in place of /vmunix, /mach, etc.

   -l    This option inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to
         login names. It is also useful when login name lookup is
         working improperly or slowly.

   +|-L [l] This option enables (`+\') or disables (`-\') the listing of file link counts,
         where they are available - e.g., they aren\'t available for sockets,
         or most FIFOs and pipes.

         When +L is specified without a following number, all link counts will be listed.
         When -L is specified (the default), no link counts will be listed.

         When +L is followed by a number, only files having a link count less than that
         number will be listed.  (No number can follow -L.)
         A specification of the form `+L1\' will select open files that have been unlinked.
         A specification of the form `+aL1 \' will select unlinked open files on
         the specified file system.

         For other link count comparisons, use field output (-F) and a
         post-processing script or program.

   -m m  This option specifies a kernel memory file, c, in place of
         /dev/kmem or /dev/mem - e.g., a crash dump file.

   +|-M  Enables (+) or disables (-) the reporting of portmapper registrations for local TCP and UDP ports.
         See the lsof FAQ for more detail.

   -n    This option inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host
         names for network files. Inhibiting conversion can make lsof run faster.
         It is also useful when host name lookup is not working properly.

   -N    This option selects the listing of NFS files.

   -o     This option directs lsof to display file offset at all times.
         Consult the lsof FAQ for more information.
         The -o and -s options are mutually exclusive.

   -o o  This option defines the number of decimal digits (o) to be printed after the `0t\'
         for a file offset before the form is switched to `0x...\'.
         An o value of zero (unlimited) directs lsof to use the `0t\' form for all offset output.
         The default number is normally 8.

   -O    This option directs lsof to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by some kernel operations.
         Use this option cautiously.

   -p s  This option selects the listing of files for the processes
         whose ID numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g.,
         `123\' or `123,456\'. (There should be no spaces in the set.)

         Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set  before participating in AND option selection.

   -P    This option inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files.
         Inhibiting the conversion can make lsof run a little faster.
         It is also useful when host name lookup is not working properly.

  +|-r [t] This option puts lsof in repeat mode. There lsof lists open files as selected by other
          options, delays t seconds (default fifteen), then repeats the listing, delaying and
         listing repetitively until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the option.

         If the prefix is a `-\', repeat mode is endless. Lsof must be terminated with an interrupt
         or quit signal.

         If the prefix is `+\', repeat mode will end the first cycle no open files are listed
          - and of course when lsof is stopped with an interrupt or quit signal.
         When repeat mode ends because no files are listed, the process exit code will be
         zero if any open files were ever listed; one, if none were ever listed.

         Lsof marks the end of each listing: if field output is in progress (the -F, option
         has been specified), the marker is \'m\'; otherwise the marker is \'========\'.
         The marker is followed by a NL character.

         Repeat mode reduces lsof startup overhead, so it is more efficient to use this mode than
         to call lsof repetitively from a shell script, for example.

         To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany +|-r with specification of other lsof selection
         options, so the amount of  kernel memory access lsof does will be kept to a minimum.
         Options that filter at the process level - e.g., -c, -g, -p, -u - are the most efficient selectors.

         Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see the -F, option description) and
         a supervising awk or Perl script, or a C program.

   -R    List the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.

   -s    This option directs lsof to display file size at all times.
         It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE.
         If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.

         The -o (without a following decimal digit count) and -s options are mutually exclusive.

         Since some types of files don\'t have true sizes - sockets, FIFOs, pipes, etc.
         - lsof displays for their sizes the content amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.

   -S [t] This option specifies an optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions
          - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) - that might otherwise deadlock.
         The minimum for t is two; the default is fifteen.

   -T [t] Display TCP/TPI information

   -T     with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI info.

   -T     with following character(s) selects the reporting info:

       q   selects queue length reporting.
       s   selects state reporting.
       w   selects window size reporting (not all dialects).

   -t Terse output with process identifiers only and no header - 
         e.g., so that the output can be piped to kill(1).
         This option selects the -w option.

   -u s  This option selects the listing of files for the user whose
         login names or user ID numbers are in the comma-separated set
         s - e.g., `abe\', or `548,root\'.  (There should be no spaces in the set.)

         Multiple login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single
         ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

         If a login name or user ID is preceded by a `^\', it becomes a negation
         - i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or user ID will never be listed.
         For example, to direct lsof to exclude the listing of files belonging to root processes
         specify `-u^root\' or `-u^0\'.

   -U    This option selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.

   -v    This option selects the listing of lsof version information,
         including: revision number; when the lsof binary was constructed; who constructed
         the binary and where; the name of the compiler used to construct the lsof binary;
         the version number of the compiler when readily available; the compiler
         and loader flags used to construct the lsof binary; and system information,
         typically the output of uname\'s -a option.

   -V    This option directs lsof to indicate the items it was asked to list and failed to find
          - command names, file names, Internet addresses or files, login names, NFS files,
         PIDs, PGIDs, and  UIDs.

         When other options are ANDed to search options, or compile-time options restrict the listing
         of some files, lsof might not report that it failed to find a search item when an ANDed
         option or compile-time option prevents the listing of the open file containing the located search item.

   +|-w  Enables (+) or disables (-) the suppression of warning messages.
         The -t option selects the -w option.

   -X    This is a dialect-specific option.

   --    The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the end of the keyed options.
         It can be used, for example, when the first file name begins with a minus sign.
         It can also be used when the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be
         signified by the presence of a minus sign in the following option and before the start of the file names.

  names  These are path names of specific files to list.
         Symbolic links are resolved before use. The first name can be separated from
         the preceding options with the -- option.

      mount [-dfruvw] special | node

      mount [-dfruvw] [-o options] [-t ufs | lfs | external_type] special node

Options
   -a  All the filesystems described in fstab(5) are mounted.  Excep-
  tions are those marked as ``noauto\'\' or are excluded by the -t
        flag (see below).
     

  -d  Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.
  This option is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to deter-
  mine what the mount command is trying to do.

  -f  Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a
  filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.

  -o  Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma sepa-
  rated string of options.  The following options are available:

       async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
         This can be somewhat dangerous with respect to losing
         data when faced with system crashes and power outages.
         This is also the default.  It can be avoided with the
         noasync option.

       force   The same as -f; forces the revocation of write access
         when trying to downgrade a filesystem mount status from
         read-write to read-only.

       noasync
         This filesystem should not force all I/O to be written
         asynchronously.

       noauto  This filesystem should be skipped when mount is run with
         the -a flag.

       nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
         the file system.  This option is useful for a server that
         has file systems containing special devices for architec-
         tures other than its own.

       noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
         file system.  This option is useful for a server that has
         file systems containing binaries for architectures other
         than its own.

       nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
         bits to take effect.

       rdonly  The same as -r; mount the file system read-only (even the
         super-user can not write it).

       sync    All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

       update  The same as -u; indicate that the status of an already
         mounted file system should be changed.

       union   Causes the namespace at the mount point to appear as the
         union of the mounted filesystem root and the existing
         directory.   Lookups will be done in the mounted filesys-
         tem first.   If those operations fail due to a non-exis-
         tent file the underlying directory is then accessed.  All
         creates are done in the mounted filesystem.

       Any additional options specific to a filesystem type that is not
       one of the internally known types (see the -t option) can be
       passed as a comma separated list; these options are distinguished
       by a leading ``-\'\' (dash).   Options that take a value are speci-
       fied using the syntax -option=value.  For example, the mount com-
       mand:
       mount -t hfs -o nosuid,-w,-m=755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

       causes mount to execute the equivalent of:

       /sbin/mount_hfs -o nosuid -w -m 755 /dev/disk2s9 /tmp

  -r  The file system is to be mounted read-only.  Mount the file sys-
  tem read-only (even the super-user can not write it).  The same
  as the ``rdonly\'\' argument to the -o option.

  -t ufs | lfs | external type

  The argument following the -t is used to indicate the file system
  type.  The type ufs is the default.  The -t option can be used to
  indicate that the actions should only be taken on filesystems of
  the specified type.  More than one type can be specified in a
  comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be pre-
  fixed with ``no\'\' to specify the filesystem types for which
  action should not be taken.  For example, the mount command:

     mount -a -t nonfs,hfs

  mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and HFS.

  If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
  attempt to execute a program in /sbin/mount_XXX where XXX is
  replaced by the type name.   For example, nfs filesystems are
  mounted by the program /sbin/mount_nfs.

  -u  The -u flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
  system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
  (the -o option) can be changed; also a file system can be changed
  from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
  from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the
  filesystem are currently open for writing unless the -f flag is
  also specified.  The set of options is determined by first
  extracting the options for the file system from the fstab table,
  then applying any options specified by the -o argument, and
  finally applying the -r or -w option.

  -v  Verbose mode.

  -w  The file system object is to be read and write.

  The options specific to NFS filesystems are described in the
  mount_nfs(8) manual page.', 'osx');

           The IP of the interface which is used to send the packets.
           It is an error to use this option in conjunction with the -l option.

   -t      Send RFC 854 DON\'T and WON\'T responses to RFC 854 DO and WILL requests.
           This makes it possible to use nc to script telnet sessions.

   -U      Use Unix Domain Sockets.

   -u      Use UDP instead of the default option of TCP.

   -v      Give more verbose output.

   -w timeout
           If a connection and stdin are idle for more than timeout seconds,
           then the connection is silently closed.  The -w flag has no
           effect on the -l option, i.e. nc will listen forever for a con-
           nection, with or without the -w flag.  The default is no timeout.

   -X proxy_version
           Requests that nc should use the specified protocol when talking
           to the proxy server.  Supported protocols are \'4\' (SOCKS v.4),
           \'5\' (SOCKS v.5) and \'connect\' (HTTPS proxy).  If the protocol
           is not specified, SOCKS version 5 is used.

   -x proxy_address[:port]
           Connect to hostname using a proxy at proxy_address and port.
           If port is not specified, the well-known port for the proxy 
           protocol is used (1080 for SOCKS, 3128 for HTTPS).

   -z      Just scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them.
           It is an error to use this option in conjunction with the -l option.', 'osx');

Options
       The first argument should be used to  specify the  protocol to use
       when executing a certain command. ADS is used for ActiveDirectory,
       RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and  RPC can be used for NT4
       and above. If this argument is omitted, net will  try to determine
       it automatically. Not all commands are available on all protocols.

  -h|--help
        Print a summary of command line options.

       -w target-workgroup
        Sets target workgroup or domain. You have to specify either this
        option or the IP address or the name of a server.

       -W workgroup
        Sets client workgroup or domain

       -U user
        User name to use

       -I ip-address
        IP address of target server to use. You have to  specify  either
        this option or a target workgroup or a target server.

       -p port
        Port  on  the  target server to connect to (usually 139 or 445).
        Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139.

       -n primary netbios name
        This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name  that   Samba
        uses  for   itself. This is identical to setting the netbios name
        parameter in the smb.conf file. However, a command line  setting
        will take precedence over settings in smb.conf.

       -s configuration file
        The  file   specified contains the configuration details required
        by the server. The information in this file includes server-spe-
        cific  information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
        descriptions of all the services that the server is to  provide.
        See  smb.conf  for  more  information. The default configuration
        file name is determined at compile time.

       -S server
        Name of target server. You should specify either this option  or
        a target workgroup or a target IP address.

       -l     When listing data, give more information on each item.

       -P     Make queries to the external server using the machine account of
        the local server.

       -d|--debug=debuglevel
        debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
        parameter is not specified is zero.

        The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
        files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only crit-
        ical  errors  and   serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a
        reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates  a   small
        amount of information about operations carried out.

        Levels  above  1 will generate considerable amounts of log data,
        and should only be used when  investigating  a  problem.  Levels
        above  3  are  designed  for use only by developers and generate
        HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

        Note that specifying this parameter here will override  the  log
        level parameter in the smb.conf file.', 'osx');

OPTIONS

-b STYLE
     Select the numbering style for lines in the body section of each
     logical page.  When a line is not numbered, the current line number
     is not incremented, but the line number separator character is
     still prepended to the line.  
     The styles are:

     \'a\'          number all lines,

     \'t\'          number only nonempty lines (default for body),

     \'n\'          do not number lines (default for header and footer),

     \'pREGEXP\'    number only lines that contain a match for REGEXP.

-d CD
     Set the section delimiter characters to CD; default is \'\\:\'. If
     only C is given, the second remains \':\'.  (Remember to protect \'\\\'
     or other metacharacters from shell expansion with quotes or extra
     backslashes.)

-f STYLE
     Specify the same as -b type except for logical page footer lines.
     The default type for logical page footer lines is n.

-h STYLE
     Specify the same as -b type except for logical page header lines.
     The default type for logical page header lines is n.

-i INCR
     Increment line numbers by INCR (default 1).

-l NUMBER
     If numbering of all lines is specified for the current logical section using the
     corresponding -b a, -f a or -h a option, specify the number of adjacent blank lines
     to be considered as one. For example, -l 2 results in only the second adjacent
     blank line being numbered. The default num value is 1.  Where fewer than NUMBER 
     consecutive empty lines occur, do not number them.  An empty line is one that
     contains no characters, not even spaces or tabs.

-n FORMAT
     Select the line numbering format (default is \'rn\'):

    \'ln\'     left justified, no leading zeros;

    \'rn\'     right justified, no leading zeros;

    \'rz\'     right justified, leading zeros.

-p
     Do not reset the line number at the start of a logical page.

-s SEP
     Separate the line number from the text line in the output with
     SEP (default is the TAB character).

-v NUMBER
     Set the initial line number on each logical page to NUMBER
     (default 1).

PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
       Several commands accept password arguments, typically using -passin and -passout for
       input and output passwords respectively. These allow the password to be obtained from a
       variety of sources. Both of these options take a single argument whose format is
       described below. If no password argument is given and a password is required then the
       user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the current terminal
       with echoing turned off.

       pass:password
                 the actual password is password. Since the password is visible to utilities
                 (like \'ps\' under Unix) this form should only be used where security is not
                 important.

       env:var   obtain the password from the environment variable var. Since the environment
                 of other processes is visible on certain platforms (e.g. ps under certain
                 Unix OSes) this option should be used with caution.

       file:pathname
                 the first line of pathname is the password. If the same pathname argument is
                 supplied to -passin and -passout arguments then the first line will be used
                 for the input password and the next line for the output password. pathname
                 need not refer to a regular file: it could for example refer to a device or
                 named pipe.

       fd:number read the password from the file descriptor number. This can be used to send
                 the data via a pipe for example.

       stdin     read the password from standard input.', 'osx');

Options
   -l language
         Override the language for any plain text files.
         Normally, plain text files are compiled as AppleScript.

   -e command
         Enter one line of a script.  Script commands given via -e are prepended
         to the normal source, if any.  Multiple -e commands can be given to build
         up a multi-line script.
         Because most scripts use characters that are special to many shell programs
         (e.g., Apple-Script uses single and double quote marks, (, ), and *),
         the command will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell intact.

   -o name
         Place the output in the file name.
         If -o is not specified, the resulting script is placed in the file \'a.scpt\'.

   -d    Place the resulting script in the data fork of the output file.

   -r type:id
         Place the resulting script in the resource fork of the output file, in the
         specified resource.

   -t type
         Set the output file type to type.  Type is a four-character code.
         If this option is omitted and the output file does not exist, the
         type is set to \'osas\', that is, a compiled script.

   -c creator
         Set the output file creator to creator.  Creator is a four-charac-

      osascript [-l language] [-e command] [-s flags] [programfile]

Key:
   -e command
      Enter one line of a script.  Multiple -e commands can be given to build up a multi-line script.
      If -e is given, osascript will not look for a filename in the argument list.
 
      Because most scripts use characters that are special to many shell programs
      (e.g., Apple-Script uses single and double quote marks, (, ), and *), the command
      will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell intact.

   -i
      Interactive mode: osascript will prompt for one line at a time, and output the result, if applicable,
      after each line. Any script supplied as a command argument using -e or programfile will be loaded,
      but not executed, before starting the interactive prompt. 

   -l language
      Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain text files are compiled as AppleScript.

   -s flags
     Modify the output style.  The flags argument is a string consisting of any of the
     modifier characters e, h, o, and s. 
     Multiple modifiers can be concatenated in the same string, and multiple -s options can be specified.

     The modifiers come in exclusive pairs;
     if conflicting modifiers are specified, the last one takes precedence.
     The meanings of the modifier characters are as follows:

        h  Print values in human-readable form (default).
        s  Print values in recompilable source form.

     osascript normally prints its results in human-readable form:
     strings do not have quotes around them, characters are not escaped,
     braces for lists and records are omitted, etc.  This is generally more useful, but can
     introduce ambiguities.  For example, the lists \'{"foo", "bar"}\' and \'{{"foo", {"bar"}}}\' would
     both be displayed as \'foo, bar\'.  

     To see the results in an unambiguous form that could be recompiled into the same value, use
     the s modifier:

        e  Print script errors to stderr (default).
        o  Print script errors to stdout.', 'osx');

   -A         Audible.  Output a bell (ASCII 0x07) character when no packet is received before the next
              packet is transmitted. To cater for round-trip times that are longer than the interval
              between transmissions, further missing packets cause a bell only if the maximum number of
              unreceived packets has increased.

   -a         Audible.  Include a bell (ASCII 0x07) character in the output when any packet is received.
              This option is ignored if other format options are present.

   -b boundif Bind the socket to interface boundif for sending.  This option is an Apple addition.

   -C         Prohibit the socket from using the cellular network interface.  This option is an Apple addition.

   -c count   Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
              If this option is not specified, ping will operate until interrupted.
              If this option is specified in conjunction with ping sweeps, each sweep will consist of count packets.

   -d         Debug, Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

   -D         Set the Don\'t Fragment bit.

   -f         Flood ping, output packets as fast as they come back or 100 times per second.

   -G sweepmaxsize
              Specify the maximum size of ICMP payload when sending sweeping pings.
              This option is required for ping sweeps.

   -g sweepminsize
              Specify the size of ICMP payload to start with when sending sweeping pings.
              The default value is 0.

   -h sweepincrsize
              Specify the number of bytes to increment the size of ICMP payload after each sweep when
              sending sweeping pings.  The default value is 1.

   -I iface   Source multicast packets with the given interface address.
              This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -i wait    Wait wait seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one second
              between each packet.  The wait time may be fractional, but only the super-user may specify
              values less than 0.1 second.  This option is incompatible with the -f option.

   -k trafficclass
              Specifies the traffic class to use for sending ICMP packets.
              The supported traffic classes are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RD, OAM, AV, RV, VI, VO and CTL.
              By default ping uses the control traffic class (CTL).  This option is an Apple addition.

   -K netservicetype
              Specifies the network service type to use for sending ICMP packets.
              The supported network service type are BK_SYS, BK, BE, RV, AV, RD,OAM, VI, SIG and VO.
              Note this overrides the default traffic class (-k can still be specified after -K to use both).
              This option is an Apple addition.

   -L         Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -l preload If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as possible before
              falling into its normal mode of behavior. Only the super-user may use this option.

   -M mask | time
              Use ICMP_MASKREQ or ICMP_TSTAMP instead of ICMP_ECHO.
              For mask, print the netmask of the remote machine.  Set the net.inet.icmp.maskrepl MIB variable
              to enable ICMP_MASKREPLY.  For time, print the origination, reception and transmission timestamps.

   -m ttl     Set the IP Time To Live for outgoing packets.
              If not specified, the kernel uses the value of the net.inet.ip.ttl MIB variable.

   -n         Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
              names for host addresses.

   -o         Exit successfully after receiving one reply packet.

   -P policy  Policy specifies IPsec policy for the ping session.
              For details please refer to ipsec(4) and ipsec_set_policy(3).

   -p pattern
              Specify up to 16 \'pad\' bytes to fill out the packet sent.
              This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
              network. eg, \'-p ff\' will fill the packet sent with all ones.

   -Q         Somewhat quiet output.  Don\'t display ICMP error messages that are in response to our
              query messages.  Originally, the -v flag was required to display such errors, but -v
              displays all ICMP error messages.  On a busy machine, this output can be overbearing.
              Without the -Q flag, ping prints out any ICMP error messages caused by its own ECHO_REQUEST messages.

   -q         Quiet output. Only display the summary lines at startup time and when finished.
 
   -R         Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and
              display the route buffer on returned packets.
              Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes.
              Many hosts ignore or discard this option.
 
   -r         Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
              If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
              This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it
              (e.g., after the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

   -S src_addr
              Use the following IP address as the source address in outgoing packets.
              On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be used to force the source address
              to be something other than the IP address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.
              If the IP address is not one of this machine\'s interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent.

   -s packetsize
              The number of data bytes to be sent.
              The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of
              ICMP header data. This option cannot be used with ping sweeps.

   -T ttl     Set the IP Time To Live for multicasted packets.
              This flag only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -t timeout Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been received.

   -v         Verbose output. ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.

   -W waittime
              Time in MilliSeconds to wait for a reply for each packet sent.
              If a reply arrives later, the packet is not printed as replied, but considered as replied when
              calculating statistics. n.b. Many other Unix variants specify this option in Seconds.

   -z tos     Use the specified type of service.

   --apple-connect
              Connect the socket to the destination address.  This option is an Apple addition.

   --apple-print
              Print the time a packet was received.  This option is an Apple addition.', 'osx');

  When multiple input files are specified, each is read, formatted, and written 
to standard output. ', 'Syntax
      pr [options] [file ...]

Options
     +page
     Begin output at page number page of the formatted input.

     -column
     Produce output that is columns wide (default is 1) that is written
     vertically down each column in the order in which the text is
     received from the input file.  The options -e and -i are assumed.
     This option should not be used with -m.  When used with -t, the
     minimum number of lines is used to display the output.

     -a     Modify the effect of the -column option so that the columns are
     filled across the page in a round-robin order (e.g., when column is
     2, the first input line heads column 1, the second heads column 2,
     the third is the second line in column 1, etc.).  This option
     requires the use of the -column option.

     -d     Produce output that is double spaced. An extra <newline> character
     is output following every <newline> found in the input.

     -e [char][gap]

     Expand each input <tab> to the next greater column position speci-
     fied by the formula n*gap+1, where n is an integer > 0.  If gap is
     zero or is omitted the default is 8.   All <tab> characters in the
     input are expanded into the appropriate number of <space>s.  If any
     nondigit character, char, is specified, it is used as the input tab
     character.

     -F     Use a <form-feed> character for new pages, instead of the default
     behavior that uses a sequence of <newline> characters.

     -h header

     Use the string header to replace the file name in the header line.

     -i [char][gap]
     In output, replace multiple <space>s with <tab>s whenever two or
     more adjacent <space>s reach column positions gap+1, 2*gap+1, etc.
     If gap is zero or omitted, default <tab> settings at every eighth
     column position is used.  If any nondigit character, char, is spec-
     ified, it is used as the output <tab> character.

     -l lines

     Override the 66 line default and reset the page length to lines. If
     lines is not greater than the sum of both the header and trailer
     depths (in lines), the pr utility suppresses output of both the
     header and trailer, as if the -t option were in effect.

     -m     Merge the contents of multiple files.  One line from each file
     specified by a file operand is written side by side into text
     columns of equal fixed widths, in terms of the number of column
     positions.  The number of text columns depends on the number of
     file operands successfully opened.  The maximum number of files
     merged depends on page width and the per process open file limit.
     The options -e and -i are assumed.

     -n [char][width]

     Provide width digit line numbering.  The default for width, if not
     specified, is 5.  The number occupies the first width column posi-
     tions of each text column or each line of -m output.   If char (any
     nondigit character) is given, it is appended to the line number to
     separate it from whatever follows. The default for char is a <tab>.
     Line numbers longer than width columns are truncated.

     -o offset

     Each line of output is preceded by offset <spaces>s.   If the -o
     option is not specified, the default is zero.  The space taken is
     in addition to the output line width.

     -r     Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open a file.

     -s char

     Separate text columns by the single character char instead of by
     the appropriate number of <space>s (default for char is the <tab>
     character).

     -t     Print neither the five-line identifying header nor the five-line
     trailer usually supplied for each page.  Quit printing after the
     last line of each file without spacing to the end of the page.

     -w width

     Set the width of the line to width column positions for multiple
     text-column output only.  If the -w option is not specified and the
     -s option is not specified, the default width is 72.   If the -w
     option is not specified and the -s option is specified, the default
     width is 512.

      option.  This will result in the current status being reported as
      well as the status when/if the network configuration changes.

      A zero exit status will be returned when the reachability status is
      reported correctly.  A non-zero exit status will be returned if
      errors are detected with an error reported to standard error.

   -w dynamic-store-key [-t timeout]
      Check if the specified key exists in the "dynamic store" data main-
      tained by configd(8).  If present, scutil will return with a zero
      exit status.  If not present, scutil will wait for the specified time
      for data to be associated with or a notification to be posted using
      the key.  A non-zero exit status will be returned if the key was not
      created/posted within the specified time.

      scutil will wait indefinitely if a timeout of 0 seconds is specified.
      The default timeout is 15 seconds.

   --get pref
      Retrieves the specified preference.  The current value will be
      reported on standard output.

      Supported preferences include:

            ComputerName   The user-friendly name for the system.

            LocalHostName  The local (Bonjour) host name.

            HostName       The name associated with hostname(1) and
                           gethostname(3).

   --set pref [newval]
      Updates the specified preference with the new value.  If the new
      value is not specified on the command line then it will be read from
      standard input.

      Supported preferences include: ComputerName LocalHostName HostName

      The --set option requires super-user access.

   --dns
      Reports the current DNS configuration.

   cdable_vars
          If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be
          the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.
   cdspell If  set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be
          corrected.  The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and
          one character too many.  If a correction is found, the corrected file name is printed,
          and the command proceeds.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
   checkhash
          If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash table  exists  before  trying  to
          execute  it.  If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.
   checkwinsize
          If set, bash checks the window size after each command and, if necessary, updates  the
          values of LINES and COLUMNS.
   cmdhist If set, bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history
           entry.  This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.
   dotglob If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a `.\' in the results of pathname expansion.
   execfail
          If  set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified
          as an argument to the exec builtin command.  An interactive shell  does  not  exit  if
          exec fails.
   expand_aliases
          If set, aliases are expanded as described above under ALIASES.  This option is enabled
          by default for interactive shells.
   extdebug
          If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
          1.     The -F option to the declare builtin displays the source  file  name  and  line
                 number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.
          2.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command
                 is skipped and not executed.
          3.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2,  and  the  shell  is
                 executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell script executed by the .
                 or source builtins), a call to return is simulated.
          4.     BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their descriptions above.
          5.     Function tracing is enabled:  command substitution, shell functions, and subshells
                 invoked with ( command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.
          6.     Error tracing is enabled:  command substitution, shell functions, and subshells
                 invoked with ( command ) inherit the ERROR trap.
   extglob
          If set, the extended pattern matching features described above under  Pathname Expansion
          are enabled.
   extquote
          If  set,  $\'string\'  and $"string" quoting is performed within ${parameter} expansions
          enclosed in double quotes.  This option is enabled by default.
   failglob
          If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in  an
          expansion error.
   force_fignore
          If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable cause words to be ignored
          when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only possible completions.
          See  SHELL VARIABLES  for a description of FIGNORE.  This option is enabled by default.
   gnu_errfmt
          If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.
   histappend
          If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE
          variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.
   histreedit
          If  set, and readline is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a
          failed history substitution.
   histverify
          If set, and readline is being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately
          passed  to  the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the
          readline editing buffer, allowing further modification.
   hostcomplete
          If set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to perform  hostname  completion
          when  a  word containing a @ is being completed (see Completing under READLINE).
          This is enabled by default.
   huponexit
          If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.
   interactive_comments
          If set, allow a word beginning with # to cause that word and all remaining  characters
          on  that line to be ignored in an interactive shell (see COMMENTS).  This option
          is enabled by default.
   lithist If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to  the  his-tory history
          tory with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.
   login_shell
          The  shell  sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see INVOCATION).
          The value may not be changed.
   mailwarn
          If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has been  accessed  since  the  last
          time  it was checked, the message ``The mail in mailfile has been read\'\' is displayed.
   no_empty_cmd_completion
          If set, and readline is being used, bash will not attempt to search the PATH for  pos-sible possible
          sible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.
   nocaseglob
          If  set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname
          expansion (see Pathname Expansion).
   nocasematch
          If set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when  performing  matching

  Sort, merge, or compare all the lines from the files given (or standard input.)', 'Syntax
      sort [options...] [file...]

Options
   sort has three modes of operation:
      Sort (the default), Merge (-m), and Check(-c)

       -c     Check whether the given files are already sorted:   if  they  are
              not all sorted, print an error message and exit with a status of 1.

       -m     Merge the given files by sorting them as a group. Each input
              file should already be individually sorted.  It always works to
              sort instead of merge; merging is provided because it is faster,
              in the case where it works.

Ordering Options:  (these affect the order of output lines)

       -b     Ignore leading blanks when finding sort keys in each line.

       -d     Sort  in dictionary `phone directory\' order: ignore all characters except
              letters, digits and blanks when sorting.

       -f     Fold lower case characters into the equivalent upper case characters
              when sorting so that, for example, `b\' is sorted the same way `B\' is.

       -i     Ignore characters outside the ASCII range 040-0176 octal (inclusive)
              when sorting.

       -M     An initial string, consisting of any amount of white space, fol-
              lowed by three letters abbreviating a month name, is  folded  to
              UPPER  case  and compared  in  the  order `JAN\' < `FEB\' < ... <
              `DEC.\'  Invalid names compare low to valid names.

       -n     Compare according to arithmetic value an initial numeric string
              consisting of optional white space, an optional - sign, and zero
              or more digits, optionally followed by a decimal point and  zero
              or more digits.

       -r     Reverse the result of comparison, so that lines with greater key
              values appear earlier in the output instead of later.

Other options:

       -o output-file
        Write output to output-file instead of to standard output.
        If output-file is one of the input files, sort copies it to a
        temporary file before sorting and writing the output to output-
        file.

       -t separator
        Use character separator as the field separator when finding the
        sort keys in each line.  By default, fields are separated by the
        empty string between a non-whitespace character and a whitespace
        character.  That is to say, given the input  line   `  foo   bar\',
        sort breaks it into fields ` foo\' and ` bar\'.  The field separa-
        tor is not considered to be part of either the  field  preceding
        or the field following it.

       -u
        For the default case or the -m option, only output the first of
        a sequence of lines that compare equal.  For  the  -c  option,
        check that no pair of consecutive lines compares equal.

       +POS1 [-POS2]
        Specify  a  field within each line to use as a sorting key.  The
        field consists of the portion of the line starting at  POS1  and
        up  to  (but  not   including) POS2 (or to the end of the line if
        POS2 is not given).  The fields and character positions are num-
        bered starting with 0.

       -k POS1[,POS2]
        An alternate syntax for specifying sorting keys.  The fields and
        character positions are numbered starting with 1.

   -L      Use stat(2) instead of lstat(2).  The information reported by stat will refer to the target of file,

   -q      Suppress failure messages if calls to stat(2) or lstat(2) fail.

   -r      Display raw information.  That is, for all the fields in the stat structure,
           display the raw, numerical value (for example, times in seconds since the epoch, etc.).

   -s      Display information in \'shell output\', suitable for initializing variables.

   -t timefmt  Display timestamps using the specified format.  This format is passed directly to strftime(3).

   -x      Display information in a more verbose way as known from some Linux distributions.

              that selects the field of the struct stat which is to be formatted.
              If the % is immediately followed by one of n, t, %, or @, then a newline character,
              a tab character, a percent character, or the current file number is printed,

                   a sign.
              -    Aligns string output to the left of the field, instead of to the right.
              0    Sets the fill character for left padding to the `0\' character, instead of a space.
              space   Reserves a space at the front of non-negative signed output fields.
                      A \'+\' overrides a space if both are used.

              Then the following fields:
              size    An optional decimal digit string specifying the minimum field width.
              prec    An optional precision composed of a decimal point \'.\' and a decimal digit
                      string that indicates the maximum string length, the number of digits to
                      appear after the decimal point in floating point output, or the minimum
                      number of digits to appear in numeric output.
              fmt     An optional output format specifier which is one of D, O, U, X, F, or S.
                      These represent signed decimal output, octal output, unsigned decimal output,
                      hexadecimal output, floating point output, and string output, respectively.
                      Some output formats do not apply to all fields.  Floating point output only
                      applies to timespec fields (the a, m, and c fields).
                      The special output specifier S may be used to indicate that the output,
                      if applicable, should be in string format.

                      May be used in combination with:
                      amc     Display date in strftime(3) format.
                      dr      Display actual device name.
                      gu      Display group or user name.
                      p       Display the mode of file as in ls -lTd.
                      N       Displays the name of file.
                      T       Displays the type of file.
                      Y       Insert a \' -> \' into the output.  Note that the default output
                              format for Y is a string, but if specified explicitly,
                              these four characters are prepended.
              sub     An optional sub field specifier (high, middle, low).
                      Only applies to the p, d, r, and T output formats.  It can be one of
                      the following:
                      H       \'High\' -- specifies the major number for devices from r or d,
                              the \'user\' bits for permissions from the string form of p, the file \'type\'
                              bits from the numeric forms of p, and the long output form of T.
                      L       \'Low\' -- specifies the minor number for devices from r or d, the \'other\'
                              bits for permissions from the string form of p, the \'user\', \'group\',
                              and \'other\' bits from the numeric forms of p, and the ls -F style output
                              character for file type when used with T (the use of L for this is optional).
                      M       \'Middle\' -- specifies the \'group\' bits for permissions from the string
                              output form of p, or the \'suid\',\'sgid\', and \'sticky\' bits for the
                              numeric forms of p.
              datum   A required field specifier, being one of the following:
                      d       Device upon which file resides.
                      i       file\'s inode number.
                      p       File type and permissions.
                      l       Number of hard links to file.
                      u, g    User ID and group ID of file\'s owner.
                      r       Device number for character and block device special files.
                      a, m, c, B   The time file was last accessed or modified, of when the inode was last
                              changed, or the birth time of the inode.
                      z       The size of file in bytes.
                      b       Number of blocks allocated for file.
                      k       Optimal file system I/O operation block size.
                      f       User defined flags for file.
                      v       Inode generation number.

                      The following four field specifiers are not drawn directly from the data in struct stat,
                      but are:      N   The name of the file.
                                    T   The file type, either as in ls -F or in a more descriptive form if
                                        the sub field specifier H is given.
                                    Y   The target of a symbolic link.
                                    Z   Expands to \'major,minor\' from the rdev field for character or block
                                        special devices and gives size output for all others.

               Only the % and the field specifier are required. Most field specifiers default to U as an
               output form, with the exception of p which defaults to O, a, m, and c which default to
               D, and Y, T, and N which default to S.

       sudo -V | -h | -l | -L | -v | -k | -K | -s command

Options
   -a  The -a (authentication type) option causes sudo to use the specified
       authentication type when validating the user, as allowed by
        /etc/login.conf.  The system administrator may specify a list of sudo-specific
       authentication methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry in /etc/login.conf.
       This option is only available on systems that support BSD authentication
       where sudo has been configured with the --with-bsdauth option.

   -b  The -b (background) option tells sudo to run the given command in the
       background.  Note that if you use the -b option you cannot use shell job control
       to manipulate the process.

   -c  The -c (class) option causes sudo to run the specified command with resources
       limited by the specified login class.  The class argument can be either 
       a class name as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single \'-\' character.
       Specifying a class of - indicates that the command should be run
       restricted by the default login capabilities for the user the command
       is run as.  If the class argument specifies an existing user class,
       the command must be run as root, or the sudo command must be run from 
       a shell that is already root.  This option is only available on systems
       with BSD login classes where sudo has been configured with the --with-logincap option.

   -h  The -h (help) option causes sudo to print a usage message and exit.

   -H  The -H (HOME) option sets the HOME environment variable to the homedir
       of the target user (root by default) as specified in
       passwd(5).  By default, sudo does not modify HOME.

   -k  The -k (kill) option to sudo invalidates the user\'s timestamp by setting the
       time on it to the epoch.   The next time sudo is run a password will
       be required.  This option does not require a password and was added to
       allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file.

   -K  The -K (sure kill) option to sudo removes the user\'s timestamp
       entirely.  Likewise, this option does not require a password.

   -l  The -l (list) option will list out the allowed (and forbidden) commands
       for the user on the current host.

   -L  The -L (list defaults) option will list out the parameters that may
       be set in a Defaults line along with a short description for each.
       This option is useful in conjunction with grep(1).

   -p  The -p (prompt) option allows you to override the default password
       prompt and use a custom one.   If the password prompt contains the
       %u escape, %u will be replaced with the user\'s login name.
       Similarly, %h will be replaced with the local hostname.

   -P  The -P (preserve group vector) option causes sudo to preserve the
       user\'s group vector unaltered.  By default, sudo will initialize
       the group vector to the list of groups the target user is in.  The
       real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the
       target user.

   -s  The -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment
       variable if it is set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).

   -S  The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from standard
       input instead of the terminal device.

   -u  The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified command as a
       user other than root.  To specify a uid instead of a username, use #uid.

   -v  If given the -v (validate) option, sudo will update the user\'s
       timestamp, prompting for the user\'s password if necessary.  This
       extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever the
       timeout is set to in sudoers) but does not run a command.

   -V  The -V (version) option causes sudo to print the version number and exit.
       If the invoking user is already root the -V option will print out a list of the 
       defaults sudo was compiled with as well as the machine\'s local network addresses.

   --  The -- flag indicates that sudo should stop processing command line
       arguments.  It is most useful in conjunction with the -s flag.', 'osx');

     -a      List all the currently available non-opaque values.  This option
             is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on the
             command line.

     -b      Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary format.
             No names are printed and no terminating newlines are output.
             This is mostly useful with a single variable.

     -d      Print the description of the variable instead of its value.

     -e      Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with =.
             This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
             sysctl utility.  This option is ignored if either -N or -n is specified,
             or a variable is being set.

     -h      Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.

     -i      Ignore unknown OIDs.  The purpose is to make use of sysctl for
             collecting data from a variety of machines (not all of which are
             necessarily running exactly the same software) easier.

     -N      Show only variable names, not their values.  This is particularly
             useful with shells that offer programmable completion.  To enable
             completion of variable names in zsh(1) (ports/shells/zsh), use
             the following code:

                   listsysctls () { set -A reply $(sysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
                   compctl -K listsysctls sysctl

             To enable completion of variable names in tcsh(1), use:

                   complete sysctl \'n/*/`sysctl -Na`/\'

     -n      Show only variable values, not their names.
             This option is useful for setting shell variables. 
             For instance, to save the pagesize in variable psize, use:

                   set psize=`sysctl -n hw.pagesize`

     -o      Show opaque variables (which are normally suppressed).  The format and length
             are printed, as well as a hex dump of the first sixteen bytes of the value.

     -q      Suppress some warnings generated by sysctl to standard error.

     -X      Equivalent to -x -a (for compatibility).

     -x      As -o, but prints a hex dump of the entire value instead of just the first few bytes.', 'osx');

Options:
       -A     Print each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII.  Handy for capturing web pages.

       -B     Set the operating system capture buffer size to buffer_size.

       -c     Exit after receiving count packets.

       -C     Before  writing  a  raw  packet to a savefile, check whether the file is currently larger than
              file_size and, if so, close the current savefile and open a  new  one.   Savefiles  after  the
              first savefile will have the name specified with the -w flag, with a number after it, starting
              at 1 and continuing upward.  The units of file_size are millions of  bytes  (1,000,000  bytes,
              not 1,048,576 bytes).

       -d     Dump the compiled packet-matching code in a human readable form to standard output and stop.

       -dd    Dump packet-matching code as a C program fragment.

       -ddd   Dump packet-matching code as decimal numbers (preceded with a count).

       -D     Print the list of the network interfaces available on the system and on which tcpdump can capture
              packets.  For each network interface, a number and an interface name, possibly  followed
              by  a  text description of the interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be
              supplied to the -i flag to specify an interface on which to capture.

              This can be useful on systems that don\'t have a command to list them (e.g., Windows  systems,
              or  UNIX systems lacking ifconfig -a); the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems,
              where the interface name is a somewhat complex string.

              The -D flag will not be supported if tcpdump was built with an older version of libpcap that
              lacks the pcap_findalldevs() function.

       -e     Print the link-level header on each dump line.

       -E     Use  spi@ipaddr  algo:secret  for  decrypting IPsec ESP packets that are addressed to addr and
              contain Security Parameter Index value spi. This combination may be repeated with comma or
              newline separation.

              Note that setting the secret for IPv4 ESP packets is supported at this time.

              Algorithms may be des-cbc, 3des-cbc, blowfish-cbc, rc3-cbc, cast128-cbc, or none. The default
              is des-cbc. The ability to decrypt packets is only present if tcpdump was compiled with cryptography
              enabled.

              secret is the ASCII text for ESP secret key. If preceeded by 0x, then a hex value will be read.

              The option assumes RFC2406 ESP, not RFC1827 ESP.  The option is only for debugging  purposes,
              and  the  use  of  this  option  with a true \'secret\' key is discouraged.  By presenting IPsec
              secret key onto command line you make it visible to others, via ps(1) and other occasions.

              In addition to the above syntax, the syntax file name may be used to  have  tcpdump  read  the
              provided  file in. The file is opened upon receiving the first ESP packet, so any special permissions
              that tcpdump may have been given should already have been given up.

       -f     Print \'foreign\' IPv4 addresses numerically rather than symbolically (this option is intended
              to get around serious brain damage in Sun\'s NIS server -- usually it hangs forever translating
              non-local internet numbers).

              The test for \'foreign\' IPv4 addresses is done using the IPv4 address and netmask of the interface
               on which capture is being done.  If that address or netmask are not available, available,
              either because the interface on which capture is being done  has  no  address  or  netmask  or
              because the capture is being done on the Linux "any" interface, which can capture on more than
              one interface, this option will not work correctly.

       -F     Use file as input for the filter expression.  An additional expression given  on  the  command
              line is ignored.

       -g     Do not insert line break after IP header in verbose mode for easier parsing.

       -G     If specified, rotates the dump file specified with the -w option every rotate_seconds seconds.
              Savefiles will have the name specified by -w which should include a time format as defined  by
              strftime(3).  If no time format is specified, each new file will overwrite the previous.

              If used in conjunction with the -C option, filenames will take the form of \'filecount\'.

       -i     Listen  on interface.  If unspecified, tcpdump searches the system interface list for the lowest
              numbered, configured up interface (excluding loopback).  Ties are broken by  choosing  the
              earliest match.
              On  Linux  systems  with 2.2 or later kernels, an interface argument of \'any\' can be used to
              capture packets from all interfaces.  Note that captures on the \'any\'  device  will  not  be
              done in promiscuous mode.

              If  the  -D  flag is supported, an interface number as printed by that flag can be used as the
              interface argument.

       -I     Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11  Wi-Fi  interfaces,
              and supported only on some operating systems.

              Note  that  in  monitor  mode  the adapter might disassociate from the network with which it\'s
              associated, so that you will not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter.  This
              could  prevent  accessing  files  on  a  network  server,  or  resolving host names or network
              addresses, if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network  with
              another adapter.

       -K     Don\'t attempt to verify TCP, UDP and IP checksums.  This is useful for interfaces that perform
              the checksum calculation in hardware; otherwise, all outgoing checksums  will  be  flagged  as
              bad.

       -l     Make stdout line buffered.  Useful if you want to see the data while capturing it.  E.g.,
              \'tcpdump  -l  |  tee dat\' or \'tcpdump  -l   > dat  &  tail  -f  dat\'.

       -L     List the known data link types for the interface and exit.

       -m     Load  SMI  MIB  module definitions from file module.  This option can be used several times to
              load several MIB modules into tcpdump.

       -M     Use secret as a shared secret for validating the digests found in TCP segments with  the  TCP-MD5
              MD5 option (RFC 2385), if present.

       -n     Don\'t convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.

       -N     Don\'t print domain name qualification of host names.  E.g., if you give this flag then tcpdump
              will print \'nic\' instead of \'nic.ddn.mil\'.

       -O     Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer. This is useful only if you suspect a bug in
              the optimizer.

       -p     Don\'t  put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the interface might be in promiscuous
              mode for some other reason; hence, \'-p\' cannot be used as an abbreviation for \'ether  host
              {local-hw-addr} or ether broadcast\'.

       -q     Quick (quiet?) output. Print less protocol information so output lines are shorter.

       -R     Assume  ESP/AH  packets  to be based on old specification (RFC1825 to RFC1829).  If specified,
              tcpdump will not print replay prevention field.  Since there is no protocol version  field  in
              ESP/AH specification, tcpdump cannot deduce the version of ESP/AH protocol.

       -r     Read packets from file (which was created with the -w option). Standard input is used if file
              is \'-\'.

       -S     Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.

       -s     Snarf snaplen bytes of data from each packet rather than the default of  64K  bytes. Packets
              truncated  because  of a limited snapshot are indicated in the output with \'[|proto]\', where
              proto is the name of the protocol level at which the truncation has occurred.  Note that taking
              larger snapshots both increases the amount of time it takes to process packets and,effectively,
              decreases the amount of packet buffering. This may cause packets to  be lost. You
              should  limit snaplen to the smallest number that will capture the protocol information you\'re
              interested in. Setting snaplen to 0 means use the required length to catch whole packets.

       -T     Force packets selected by "expression" to be interpreted the specified type.  Currently  known
              types are aodv (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector protocol), cnfp (Cisco NetFlow protocol), rpc
              (Remote Procedure Call), rtp (Real-Time Applications protocol), rtcp  (Real-Time  Applications
              control protocol), snmp (Simple Network Management Protocol), tftp (Trivial File Transfer Protocol),
              , vat (Visual Audio Tool), and wb (distributed White Board).

       -t     Don\'t print a timestamp on each dump line.

       -tt    Print an unformatted timestamp on each dump line.

       -ttt   Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and previous line on each dump line.

       -tttt  Print a timestamp in default format proceeded by date on each dump line.

       -ttttt Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and first line on each dump line.

       -u     Print undecoded NFS handles.

       -U     Make output saved via the -w option \'packet-buffered\'; i.e., as each  packet  is  saved,  it
              will  be  written  to  the  output file, rather than being written only when the output buffer
              fills.

              The -U flag will not be supported if tcpdump was built with an older version of  libpcap  that
              lacks the pcap_dump_flush() function.

       -v     When  parsing  and printing, produce (slightly more) verbose output.  For example, the time to
              live, identification, total length and options in an IP  packet  are  printed.   Also  enables
              additional packet integrity checks such as verifying the IP and ICMP header checksum.

              When  writing  to  a  file with the -w option, report, every 10 seconds, the number of packets
              captured.

       -vv    Even more verbose output.  For example, additional fields are printed from NFS reply  packets,
              and SMB packets are fully decoded.

       -vvv   Even more verbose output.  For example, telnet SB ... SE options are printed in full.  With -X
              Telnet options are printed in hex as well.

       -w     Write the raw packets to file rather than parsing and printing them out.  They  can  later  be
              printed with the -r option.  Standard output is used if file is \'-\'.

       -W     Used  in  conjunction  with  the -C option, this will limit the number of files created to the
              specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating  a  \'rotating\'
              buffer.   In  addition,  it  will name the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum
              number of files, allowing them to sort correctly.

              Used in conjunction with the -G option, this will limit the number of rotated dump files  that
              get  created,  exiting  with  status  0  when reaching the limit. If used with -C as well, the
              behavior will result in cyclical files per timeslice.

       -x     When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the  data
              of  each  packet  (minus  its  link level header) in hex.  The smaller of the entire packet or
              snaplen bytes will be printed.  Note that this is the entire link-layer packet,  so  for  link
              layers  that pad (e.g. Ethernet), the padding bytes will also be printed when the higher layer
              packet is shorter than the required padding.

       -xx    When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the  data
              of each packet, including its link level header, in hex.

       -X     When  parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data
              of each packet (minus its link level header) in  hex  and  ASCII.   This  is  very  handy  for
              analysing new protocols.

       -XX    When  parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data
              of each packet, including its link level header, in hex and ASCII.

       -y     Set the data link type to use while capturing packets to datalinktype.

       -z     Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make tcpdump run  "  command  file  "
              where  file  is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip
              or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.

              Note that tcpdump will run the command in parallel to the capture, using the  lowest  priority
              so that this doesn\'t disturb the capture process.

              And  in  case  you would like to use a command that itself takes flags or different arguments,
              you can always write a shell script that will take the savefile name  as  the  only  argument,
              make the flags & arguments arrangements and execute the command that you want.

       -Z     Drops  privileges  (if root) and changes user ID to user and the group ID to the primary group
              of user.

              This behavior can also be enabled by default at compile time.

       expression
              selects which packets will be dumped.  If no expression is given, all packets on the net  will
              be dumped.  Otherwise, only packets for which expression is \'true\' will be dumped.

              For the expression syntax, see pcap-filter(4).

              Expression arguments can be passed to tcpdump as either a single argument or as multiple arguments,
              whichever is more convenient.  Generally, if the expression contains Shell  metacharacters,
              it  is easier to pass it as a single, quoted argument.  Multiple arguments are concatenated
              with spaces before being parsed.

BACKUP STRUCTURE
     Throughout this manual, specific language is used to describe particular "realms" associated with Time
     Machine backups. It is important to understand this terminology to make effective use of tmutil and its
     manual.

     backup source
             A volume currently being backed up by Time Machine.

     backup disk
             The HFS+ volume that contains Time Machine backups.

     backup destination
             In the case of a local destination, a synonym for backup disk. For network destinations, this
             is the AFP share on which the backup disk image resides.

     backup disk image (or backup image)
             A sparsebundle that, when mounted, is the backing store for a volume that is a backup disk.

     backup store
             The top-level "Backups.backupdb" directory at the root of a backup disk.

     machine directory
             A directory inside a backup store that contains all the backups for a particular computer. For
             local destinations, a backup store can contain multiple machine directories, all for separate
             computers.

     snapshot
             A directory inside a machine directory that represents a single initial or incremental backup
             of one computer. The word "snapshot", in most contexts, is a generic term and is not to be confused
             with a "local Time Machine snapshot", which is a snapshot stored locally on the
             computer.

     snapshot volume
             A directory inside a snapshot that represents a single initial or incremental backup of one
             backup source. E.g.,

             /Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/thermopylae/2011-07-03-123456/Mac HD

VERBS
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

     help [verb]
             Print extended usage for a given verb. If no verb is provided, print a list of verbs and usage
             summaries.

     enable
             Turn on automatic backups. Requires root privileges.

     disable
             Turn off automatic backups. Requires root privileges.

     enablelocal
             Turn on local Time Machine snapshots. Requires root privileges.

     disablelocal
             Turn off local Time Machine snapshots and trigger automatic cleanup of accumulated local snapshot
             data. Requires root privileges.

     snapshot
             Create new local Time Machine snapshot.

     startbackup [-b | --block] [-r | --rotation] [-d | --destination dest_id]
             Perform a standard backup. This is equivalent to choosing "Back Up Now" from the Time Machine
             menu extra.

             Options:
                 --block          Wait (block) until the backup is finished before exiting.
                 --rotation       Allow automatic destination rotation during the backup.
                 --destination    Perform the backup to the destination corresponding to the specified ID.

     stopbackup
             Cancel a backup currently in progress.

     delete snapshot_path ...
             Delete one or more snapshots in an arbitrary machine directory. This verb can delete snapshots
             from backups that were not made by, or are not claimed by, the current machine. Requires root
             privileges.

     restore [-v] src ... dst
             Restore the item src, which is inside a snapshot, to the location dst. The dst argument mimics
             the destination path semantics of the cp tool. You may provide multiple source paths to
             restore. The last path argument must be a destination.

             When using the restore verb, tmutil behaves largely like Finder. Custom Time Machine metadata
             (extended security and other) will be removed from the restored data, and other metadata will
             be preserved.

             Root privileges are not strictly required to perform restores, but tmutil does no permissions
             preflighting to determine your ability to restore src or its descendants. Therefore, depending
             on what you\'re restoring, you may need root privileges to perform the restore, and you should
             know this ahead of time. This is the same behavior you would encounter with other copy tools
             such as cp or ditto. When restoring with tmutil as root, ownership of the restored items will
             match the state of the items in the backup.

     compare [-@esmugtdEX] [-D depth] [-I name] [snapshot_path | path1 path2]
             Perform a backup diff.

             If no arguments are provided, tmutil will compare the computer to the latest snapshot. If a
             snapshot path is provided as the sole argument, tmutil will compare the computer to the specified
             snapshot. If two path arguments are provided, tmutil will compare those two items to each
             other.  tmutil will attempt to inform you when you have asked it to do something that doesn\'t
             make sense or isn\'t supported.

             The compare verb allows you to specify what properties to compare. If you specify no property
             options, it is assumed that you want to compare a basic set of metadata. This default property
             set is equivalent to the -smugt option set. Specifying any property option overrides the
             default set.

             Options:
                 -a    Compare all supported metadata.
                 -@    Compare extended attributes.
                 -e    Compare ACLs.
                 -s    Compare sizes.
                 -m    Compare file modes.
                 -u    Compare UIDs.
                 -g    Compare GIDs.
                 -t    Compare modification times.
                 -d    Compare file data forks.
                 -D    Limit traversal depth to depth levels from the beginning of iteration.
                 -E    Don\'t take exclusions into account when comparing items inside volumes.
                 -I    Ignore paths with a path component equal to name during iteration. This may be specified
                       multiple times.
                 -X    Print output in XML property list format.

     setdestination [-ap] arg
             Configure a local HFS+ volume or AFP share as a backup destination. Requires root privileges.

             When the -a option is provided, arg will be added to the list of destinations. Time Machine
             will automatically choose a backup destination from the list when performing backups. When the
             -a option is not provided, the current list of destinations will be replaced by arg.

             If you wish to set an HFS+ volume as the backup destination, arg should be the mount point of
             the volume in question. When setting an AFP destination arg takes the form:

             afp://user[:pass]@host/share

             In the AFP case, the password component of the URL is optional; you may instead specify the -p
             option to enter the password at a non-echoing interactive prompt. This is of particular interest
             to the security-conscious, as all arguments provided to a program are visible by all users
             on the system via the ps tool.

     destinationinfo [-X]
             Print information about destinations currently configured for use with Time Machine. For each
             backup destination, the following information may be displayed:

                 Name          The volume label as shown in Finder.
                 Kind          Whether the destination is locally attached storage or a network device.
                 URL           In the case of a network destination, the URL used for Time Machine configuration.
                 Mount Point   If the volume is currently mounted, the path in the file system at which it
                               was mounted.
                 ID            The unique identifier for the destination.

             When more than one destination is configured, the most recent backup destination will be marked
             with the > indicator.

             When the -X option is provided, output will be printed in XML property list format.

     removedestination identifier
             Remove the destination with the specified unique identifier from the Time Machine configuration.
             Requires root privileges.

             To obtain the unique identifier for a destination, see destinationinfo.

     addexclusion [-p] item ...
             Configure an exclusion that tells Time Machine not to back up a file, directory, or volume during
             future backups.

             There are two kinds of user-configurable exclusions in Time Machine. The first, which is the
             default behavior for the addexclusion verb, is a location-independent ("sticky") exclusion that
             follows a file or directory. When the file or directory is moved, the exclusion goes with the
             item to the new location. Additionally, when the item is copied, the copy retains the exclusion.

             The second kind of exclusion is what is known as a fixed-path exclusion. In this scenario, you
             tell Time Machine that you want a specific path to be excluded, agnostic of the item at that
             path. If there is no file or directory at the specified path, the exclusion has no effect; if
             the item previously at the path has been moved or renamed, the item is not excluded, because it
             does not currently reside at the excluded path. As a consequence of these semantics, moving a
             file or directory to the path will cause the item to be excluded--fixed-path exclusions are not
             automatically cleaned up when items are moved or deleted and will take effect again once an
             item exists at an excluded path.

             The -p option sets a fixed-path exclusion as described above. Requires root privileges.

             Volume exclusions can be set with the addexclusion verb. The -p option is ignored for volumes;
             exclusions set on volumes track the volume regardless of volume name or mount path changes.
             Erasing the volume will cause it to be included in future backups. (See associatedisk.)
             Requires root privileges.

     removeexclusion [-p] item ...
             Configure Time Machine to back up a file, directory, or volume during future backups. This verb
             follows the same usage, exclusion style, and privilege semantics as addexclusion.

     isexcluded [-X] item ...
             Determine if a file, directory, or volume are excluded from Time Machine backups.

             When the -X option is provided, output will be printed in XML property list format.

             # example output for an excluded item
             thermopylae:~ thoth$ tmutil isexcluded /Users/admin/Desktop/foo.txt
             [Excluded]      /Users/admin/Desktop/foo.txt

             # example output for an item that is not excluded
             thermopylae:~ thoth$ tmutil isexcluded /Users/admin/Desktop/bar.txt
             [Included]      /Users/admin/Desktop/bar.txt

     inheritbackup {machine_directory | sparsebundle}
             Claim a machine directory or sparsebundle for use by the current machine. Requires root privileges.

             Machine directories and sparsebundles are owned by one computer at a time, and are tracked by
             unique identifiers rather than computer name, host name, or ethernet address. The inheritbackup
             verb reassigns the identity of the specified item, reconfiguring it so the current host recognizes
             it during backups. When inheriting a sparsebundle, the machine directory within will also
             be claimed.

             Inheriting is typically only one step in the process of configuring a backup for use by a
             machine. You may also need to use setdestination, associatedisk, or both, depending on the situation.

             One machine can own multiple machine directories and sparsebundles, but it is ill-advised for
             them to reside in the same place. In such a situation, which will be chosen during a backup is
             undefined. As a result, inheritbackup will attempt to detect possible identity collisions
             before making changes.

     associatedisk [-a] mount_point snapshot_volume
             Bind a snapshot volume directory to the specified local disk, thereby reconfiguring the backup
             history. Requires root privileges.

             In macOS, HFS+ volumes have a persistent UUID that is assigned when the file system is created.
             Time Machine uses this identifier to make an association between a source volume and a
             snapshot volume. Erasing the source volume creates a new file system on the disk, and the previous
              UUID is not retained. The new UUID causes the source volume -> snapshot volume assocation
             to be broken. If one were just erasing the volume and starting over, it would likely be of no
             real consequence, and the new UUID would not be a concern; when erasing a volume in order to
             clone another volume to it, recreating the association may be desired.

             A concrete example of when and how you would use associatedisk:

             After having problems with a volume, you decide to erase it and manually restore its contents
             from a Time Machine backup or copy of another nature. (I.e., not via the macOS installer\'s
             System Restore feature or Migration Assistant.) On your next incremental backup, the data will
             be copied anew, as though none of it had been backed up before. Technically, it is true that
             the data has not been backed up, given the new UUID. However, this is probably not what you
             want Time Machine to do. You would then use associatedisk to reconfigure the backup so it
             appears that this volume has been backed up previously:

             Mac64:~ thoth$ sudo tmutil associatedisk [-a] "/Volumes/MyNewStuffDisk"  "/Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/Mac64/Latest/MyStuff"

             The result of the above command would associate the snapshot volume MyStuff in the specified
             snapshot with the source volume MyNewStuffDisk. The snapshot volume would also be renamed to
             match. The -a option tells associatedisk to find all snapshot volumes in the same machine
             directory that match the identity of MyStuff, and then perform the association on all of them.

     latestbackup
             Print the path to the most recent snapshot for this computer.

     listbackups

             depending on the contents of the machine directory.

     uniquesize path ...
             Analyze the specified path and determine its unique size. The figure reported by uniquesize
             represents things that only exist in the specified path; things that are hard-linked in other

Options
     -A   Adjust the access and modification time stamps for the file by the specified value.
          This flag is intended for use in modifying files with incorrectly set time stamps.

          The argument is of the form \'[-][[hh]mm]SS\' where each pair of letters represents the following:

             -       Make the adjustment negative: the new time stamp is set to be before the old one.
             hh      The number of hours, from 00 to 99.
             mm      The number of minutes, from 00 to 59.
             SS      The number of seconds, from 00 to 59.

          The -A flag implies the -c flag: if any file specified does not exist, it will be silently ignored.

     -a   Change the access time of the file.  The modification time of the
          file is not changed unless the -m flag is also specified.

     -c   Do not create the file if it does not exist.  The touch utility does not treat this as an error.
          No error messages are displayed and the exit value is not affected.

     -f   Attempt to force the update, even if the file permissions do not currently permit it.

     -h   If the file is a symbolic link, change the times of the link itself rather than the file
          that the link points to.  Note that -h implies -c and thus will not create any new files.

     -m   Change the modification time of the file. The access time of the  file is not changed
          unless the -a flag is also specified.

     -r   Copy the access and modification times from a specified file instead of the current time of day.

     -t   Change the access and modification times to the specified time.
          The argument should be in the form \'[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]\'
          where each pair of letters represents the following:

           CC    The first two digits of the year (the century).
           YY    The second two digits of the year.  If \'YY\' is
                 specified, but \'CC\' is not, a value for \'YY\'
                 between 69 and 99 results in a \'CC\' value of 19.
                 Otherwise, a \'CC\' value of 20 is used.
           MM    The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
           DD    the day of the month, from 1 to 31.
           hh    The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
           mm    The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
           SS    The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.

          If the \'CC\' and \'YY\' letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current year.

   init    If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user\'s
           terminal exists (see -Ttype, above), output the terminal\'s initialization strings
           and turn tabs expansion on or off according to the specification in the entry

           will be output if present (rs1, rs2, rs3, rf).  If the reset strings are not
           present, but initialization strings are, the initialization  strings will be
           output. Otherwise, reset acts identically to init.

   longname
           If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user\'s  terminal exists
           (see -Ttype above), then the long name of the terminal will be put out.
           The long name is the last name in the first line of the terminal\'s description in

     character Any character not described by one of the following conven-
     tions represents itself.

     \\octal A backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits represents a
     character with that encoded value.  To follow an octal
     sequence with a digit as a character, left zero-pad the octal
     sequence to the full 3 octal digits.

     \\character
     A backslash followed by certain special characters maps to
     special values.

     \\a    <alert character>
     \\b    <backspace>
     \\f    <form-feed>
     \\n    <newline>
     \\r    <carriage return>
     \\t    <tab>
     \\v    <vertical tab>

     A backslash followed by any other character maps to that character.

     c-c Represents the range of characters between the range end-points, inclusively.

     [:class:] Represents all characters belonging to the defined character
     class. Class names are:

     alnum   <alphanumeric characters>
     alpha   <alphabetic characters>
     cntrl   <control characters>

     digit   <numeric characters>
     graph   <graphic characters>

     upper   <upper-case characters>
     xdigit   <hexadecimal characters>

     With the exception of the `upper\' and `lower\' classes,
     characters in the classes are in unspecified order.  In the
     `upper\' and `lower\' classes, characters are entered in
     ascending order.

     [=equiv=] Represents all characters belonging to the same equivalence
     class as equiv, ordered by their encoded values.

     [#*n] Represents n repeated occurrences of the character represented
     by #.  This expression is only valid when it occurs in
     string2.  If n is omitted or is zero, it is be interpreted as

               in hex.  Bytes that are unchanged in the quoted packet are shown as underscores.
               Note, the IP checksum and the TTL of the quoted packet are not expected to match.
               By default, only one probe per hop is sent with this option.

   -e          Firewall evasion mode.
               Use fixed destination ports for UDP and TCP probes. The destination port does NOT increment with each packet sent.

   -f first_ttl  Set the initial time-to-live used in the first outgoing probe packet.

   -F          Set the "don\'t fragment" bit.

   -g gateway  Specify a loose source route gateway (8 maximum).

   -i iface    Specify a network interface to obtain the source IP address for outgoing probe packets.
               This is normally only useful on a multi-homed host. (See the -s flag for another way to do this.)

   -I          Use ICMP ECHO instead of UDP datagrams.  (A synonym for "-P icmp").

   -M first_ttl  Set the initial time-to-live value used in outgoing probe packets.
                 The default is 1, i.e., start with the first hop.

   -m max_ttl  Set the max time-to-live (max number of hops) used in outgoing  probe packets.
               The default is 30 hops (the same default used for TCP connections).

   -n          Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and  numerically
               (saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each  gateway found on the path).

   -P proto    Send packets of specified IP protocol.
               The currently supported protocols are: UDP , TCP , GRE and ICMP Other protocols  may also be specified
               (either by name or by number), though traceroute does not implement any special knowledge of their
               packet formats. This option is useful for determining which router along a path may be blocking packets
               based on IP protocol number. But see BUGS below.

   -p port     Protocol specific. For UDP and TCP, sets the base port number used in probes (default is 33434).
               traceroute hopes that nothing is listening on UDP ports base to base+nhops-1 at the destination
               host (so an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message will be returned to terminate the route tracing).
               If something is listening on a port in the default range, this option can be used to pick an unused
               port range.

  packetsize   The default probe datagram length is 38 bytes, but this may be increased by
               specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the destination host name.

   -q nqueries  Set the number of probes per `ttl\' to nqueries (default is three probes).

   -r          Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
               If the host is not on a directly-attached  network, an error is returned.
               This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it
               (e.g., after the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

   -s src_addr  Use the following IP address (which must be given as an IP number, not a hostname) as
               the source address in outgoing probe packets.  On hosts with more than one IP address,
               this option can be used to force the source address to be something other than
               the IP address of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If the IP address is not
               one of this machine\'s interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent.

   -S          Print a summary of how many probes were not answered for each hop.

   -t tos      Set the type-of-service in probe packets to the following value (default zero).
               The value must be a decimal integer in the range 0 to 255.
               This option can be used to see if different types-of-service result in different paths.
               (If you are not running a 4.3BSD-Tahoe or later system, this may be academic since the normal
               network services like telnet and ftp don\'t let you control the TOS).
               Not all values of TOS are legal or meaningful - see the IP spec for definitions.
               Useful values are probably \'-t 16\' (low delay) and \'-t 8\' (high throughput).

   -v          Verbose output.  Received ICMP packets other than TIME_EXCEEDED and UNREACHABLEs are listed.

   -w          Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe (default 3 sec.).

   -x          Toggle IP checksums. Normally, this prevents traceroute from calculating IP checksums.
               In some cases, the operating system can overwrite parts of the outgoing packet but not recalculate
               the checksum (so in some cases the default is to not calculate checksums and using -x causes
               them to be calculated). Note that checksums are usually required for the last hop when using
               ICMP ECHO probes ( -I ). So they are always calculated when using ICMP.

   -z pausemsecs
               Set the time (in milliseconds) to pause between probes (default 0).
               Some systems such as Solaris and routers such as Ciscos rate limit ICMP messages.
               A good value to use with this this is 500 (e.g. 1/2 second).', 'osx');

Key
   -0
      Change xargs to expect NUL (`\\0\') characters as separators,
      instead of spaces and newlines.  This is expected to be used in
      concert with the -print0 function in find.

   -E eofstr
      Use eofstr as a logical EOF marker.

   -I replstr
      Execute utility for each input line, replacing one or more
      occurences of replstr in up to replacements (or 5 if no -R flag
      is specified) arguments to utility with the entire line of input.
      The resulting arguments, after replacement is done, will not be
      allowed to grow beyond 255 bytes; this is implemented by concate-
      nating as much of the argument containing replstr as possible, to
      the constructed arguments to utility, up to 255 bytes.  The 255
      byte limit does not apply to arguments to utility which do not
      contain replstr, and furthermore, no replacement will be done on
      utility itself.  Implies -x.

   -J replstr
      If this option is specified, xargs will use the data read from
      standard input to replace the first occurrence of replstr instead
      of appending that data after all other arguments. This option
      will not effect how many arguments will be read from input (-n),
      or the size of the command(s) xargs will generate (-s).  The
      option just moves where those arguments will be placed in the
      command(s) that are executed.  The replstr must show up as a dis-
      tinct argument to xargs.  It will not be recognized if, for
      instance, it is in the middle of a quoted string. Furthermore,
      only the first occurrence of the replstr will be replaced.  For
      example, the following command will copy the list of files and
      directories which start with an uppercase letter in the current
      directory to destdir:

      /bin/ls -1d [A-Z]* | xargs -J % cp -rp % destdir

   -L number
      Call utility for every number lines read. If EOF is reached and
      fewer lines have been read than number then utility will be
      called with the available lines.

   -n number
      Set the maximum number of arguments taken from standard input for
      each invocation of the utility.  An invocation of utility will
      use less than number standard input arguments if the number of
      bytes accumulated (see the -s option) exceeds the specified size
      or there are fewer than number arguments remaining for the last
      invocation of utility.  The current default value for number is
      5000.

   -o
      Reopen stdin as /dev/tty in the child process before executing the command.
      This is useful if you want xargs to run an interactive application.

   -P maxprocs
      Parallel mode: run at most maxprocs invocations of utility at once.

   -p
      Echo each command to be executed and ask the user whether it should be executed.
      An affirmative response, `y\' in the POSIX locale, causes the command to be executed,
      any other response causes it to be skipped.  No commands are executed if the
      process is not attached to a terminal

   -R replacements
      Specify the maximum number of arguments that -I will do replacement in.

   -s size
      Set the maximum number of bytes for the command line length pro-
      vided to utility. The sum of the length of the utility name, the
      arguments passed to utility (including NULL terminators) and the
      current environment will be less than or equal to this number.
      The current default value for size is ARG_MAX - 4096.

   -t
      Echo the command to be executed to standard error immediately before it is executed.

   /l      The locale to use when initialising the BCD store. default = US English.

   /s      Optional. Specifies the volume letter of the system partition.
           This option should not be used in typical deployment scenarios.
           Use this setting to specify a system partition when you are configuring a drive that will
           be booted on another computer, such as a USB flash drive or a secondary hard drive.
           The default is the system partition identified by the firmware.

   /v      Enable verbose mode.

   /vbcd   Enable BCD Logging.

   /m      If an OS_Loader_GUID is specified, merge the given loader object within

   /d      Preserve the existing default Windows Boot entry.

   /f      Used with /S, specifies the firmware type of the target system partition
           Options for firmware are \'UEFI\', \'BIOS\', or \'ALL\'

           If you specify \'ALL\', BCDBoot will create both the \\Boot and the \\Efi\\Microsoft\\Boot

  /addlast  Specifies that the Windows Boot Manager firmware entry should be added last.
           The default behavior is to add it first. Cannot be used with /p.

  /bcdclean Clean the BCD Store. By default, simply removes any duplicate entries in
           the BCD. Can be followed by \'full\'. In this case, each entry is scanned
           If the corresponding device for that entry does not exist, the entry is deleted.

           preserved in the UEFI boot order. If the entry does not exist, a new entry is
           added in the first position. Cannot be used with /addlast.

                    e.g. bcdedit /? createstore

   Store commands:

      /createstore  Creates a new empty boot configuration data store.
                    The created store is not a system store.

      /export       Export the contents of the system store into a file.
                    This file can be used later to restore the state of the system store.
                    Valid only for the system store.

      /import       Restore the state of the system store by using a backup data file
                    previously generated with /export.
                    This command deletes any existing entries in the system store before
                    the import takes place. Valid only for the system store.

      /store        This option can be used with most BCDedit commands to specify
                    the store to be used. If this option is not specified, then
                    BCDEdit operates on the system store.
                    Running the bcdedit /store command by itself is equivalent to running
                    the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /sysstore     Set the system store device. This only affects EFI-based systems.
                    It does not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where the system
                    store device is ambiguous.

   Operating on entries in a store:

      /copy         Make a copy of a specified boot entry in the same system store.

      /create       Create a new entry in the boot configuration data store.
                    If a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit, and
                    /device options cannot be specified. If an identifier is not specified or not well
                    known, an /application, /inherit, or /device option must be specified. 

      /delete       Delete an element from a specified entry.

      /mirror       Create a mirror of entries in the store.

   Changing entry options:

      /deletevalue  Delete a specified element from a boot entry.

      /set          Set an entry option value.

   List current settings:

      /enum [type | id] [/v]
                    List entries in a store.
                    Types: ACTIVE, FIRMWARE, BOOTAPP, BOOTMGR, OSLOADER, RESUME, INHERIT, ALL
                    The /enum option is the default value for BCEdit, so running
                    the bcdedit command without options is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.

      /v            Verbose mode.
                    Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are represented by their friendly shorthand form.
                    Specifying /v as a command-line option displays all identifiers in full.
                    Running the bcdedit /v command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active /v command.

   Controlling the boot manager:

      /bootsequence Specifies a one-time display order to be used for the next boot.
                    This command is similar to the /displayorder option, except that it is used only the
                    next time the computer starts. Afterwards, the computer reverts to the original
                    display order.
      /default      Specifies the default entry that the boot manager selects when the timeout expires.

      /displayorder Specifies the display order that the boot manager uses when displaying boot options
                    to a user.
      /timeout      Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, before the boot manager selects the default entry.

      /toolsdisplayorder  Specifies the display order for the boot manager to use when displaying the Tools menu.

   Emergency Management Services options:

      /bootems      Enable or disable Emergency Management Services (EMS) for the specified entry.

      /ems          Enable or disable EMS for the specified operating system boot entry.

      /emssettings  Set the global EMS settings for the computer.
                    /emssettings does not enable or disable EMS for any particular boot entry.

   Debugging:

      /bootdebug    Enable or disable the boot debugger for a specified boot entry.
                    Although this command works for any boot entry, it is effective only for boot applications.

      /dbgsettings  Specifies or displays the global debugger settings for the system.
                    This command does not enable or disable the kernel debugger; use the /debug option for
                    that purpose. To set an individual global debugger setting, use the
                    bcdedit /setdbgsettings type value command.

      /debug        Enable or disable the kernel debugger for a specified boot entry.

      /hypervisorsettings  Set the hypervisor parameters.

   /s scriptname.txt (one command per line)
         To create a diskpart script, create a text file scriptname.txt containing the Diskpart commands that you 
         want to run, one command per line, and no empty lines. Start a line with REM to make the line a comment.

Commands you can issue at the DISKPART prompt or in a text file:

 ACTIVE  On basic disks, mark the partition with focus as active.

         DiskPart does not check the contents of the partition. If you mistakenly mark a partition as active
         and it does not contain the operating system startup files, your computer might not start.
         This informs the basic input/output system (BIOS) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) that
         the partition or volume is a valid system partition or system volume.
         Only partitions can be marked as active. A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.
         Use the select partition command to select a partition and shift the focus to it.

 ADD disk=n [align=n] [wait] [noerr]
         Mirror the simple volume with focus to the specified disk.

 ASSIGN  [{LETTER=D  | mount=path}] [noerr]
         Assign a drive letter or mount point to the volume with focus. (Only Server 2012-2022)

         If no drive letter or mount point is specified, the next available drive letter is assigned.
         By using the assign command, you can change the drive letter associated with a removable drive.
         You cannot assign drive letters to system volumes, boot volumes, or volumes that contain the paging file.
         In addition, you cannot assign a drive letter to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partition
         or any GUID Partition Table (gpt) partition other than a basic data partition.
         A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.
         Use the select volume command to select a volume and shift the focus to it.
         ## Example To assign the letter E to the volume in focus, type: assign letter=e

 ATTRIBUTES DISK [{set | clear}] [readonly] [noerr] ATTRIBUTES VOLUME [{set | clear}] [{hidden | readonly | nodefaultdriveletter | shadowcopy}] [noerr]
         Display, set, or clear the attributes of a disk or volume.

 AUTOMOUNT [enable] [disable] [scrub] [noerr]
         Enable or disable the automount feature.

 BREAK disk=n [nokeep] [noerr]
         Break the mirrored volume with focus into two simple volumes.

 CLEAN [all]       (Server 2012-2022)
         Remove any and all partition or volume formatting from the disk with focus, \'all\' will Zero the disk.
         See also the PowerShell cmdlet clear-disk

 COMPACT vdisk       (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Reduce the physical size of a dynamically expanding virtual hard disk (VHD) file.
         This parameter is useful because dynamically expanding VHDs increase in size as you add files, but they do
         not automatically reduce in size when you delete files.

 CONVERT Convert file allocation table (FAT) and FAT32 volumes to the NTFS file system. 

 CREATE partition efi [size=n] [offset=n] [noerr]
 CREATE partition extended [size=n] [offset=n] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE partition logical [size=n] [offset=n] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE partition msr [size=n] [offset=n] [noerr]
 CREATE partition primary [size=n] [offset=n] [id={ byte | guid }] [align=n] [noerr]
         Create a partition.

 CREATE volume raid [size=n] disk=n,n,n[,n,...] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE volume simple [size=n] [disk=n] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE volume stripe [size=n] disk=n,n[,n,...] [align=n] [noerr]
 CREATE volume mirror [size=n] disk=n,n[,n,...] [align=n] [noerr]
         Create a volume.

 CREATE vdisk file=filepath {[type={fixed|expandable}] | [parent=filepath] | [source=filepath]}
                      [maximum=n] [sd=SDDL] [noerr]
         Create a virtual disk (VHD).

 DELETE disk [noerr] [override]
 DELETE partition [noerr] [override]
 DELETE volume [noerr]
         Delete a partition, volume or a dynamic disk from the list of disks.

 GPT attributes=n     (Windows Server 2012-2022)  OEM use only.
      On basic GUID partition table (gpt) disks, this command assigns the gpt attribute(s) to the partition with focus.
      Gpt partition attributes give additional information about the use of the partition.
      Some attributes are specific to the partition type GUID.
      This might cause your basic data volumes to fail to be assigned drive letters, or to prevent the file system from mounting.

 MERGE vdisk depth=n           (Windows Server 2008R2-2022)
         Merge a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD.
         depth=1 will merge with parent.
         The parent VHD will be modified to include the modifications from the differencing VHD.
         As a result, other differencing VHDs that are dependent on the parent will no longer be valid.
         You must choose and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed.
         Use the \'select vdisk\' command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

                        pattern is the naming  pattern and location of split files. 

    Examples: 
      DISM.exe /Apply-Image /ImageFile:install.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:D:\\ 

      DISM.exe /Apply-Image /ImageFile:install.swm /SWMFile:install*.swm 
        /ApplyDir:D:\\ /Index:1 

   Split an existing .wim file into multiple read-only split WIM files:
   /Split-Image /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /SWMFile:path_to_swm
        /FileSize:MB-Size [/CheckIntegrity] 

     /FileSize       - Maximum size in megabytes (MB) for each created file. 
                       If a single file is larger than the value specified, one of the split .swm files that
                       results will be larger than the value specified, in order to accommodate the large file.

     /CheckIntegrity - Detect and track WIM file corruption when used with capture, unmount, export, and
                       commit operations. /CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file
                       is corrupted when used with apply and mount operations.. 

    Example: 
      DISM.exe /Split-Image /ImageFile:install.wim /SWMFile:split.swm /FileSize:650 


   Display information about the images that the specified WIM or VHD file contains:

                        This option allows you to specify the partition that you want to optimize.

    This command should be the last command run against an image before the image is applied to a device,
    and can reduce time on the factory floor when building devices for build-to-stock scenarios.

     DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Optimize-Image {/Boot | /WimBoot}

     /Boot  Tries to reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            This optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed on the image
            after optimizing it.  DISM /Optimize-Image /boot is available in the following operating systems: Windows 11,
            Windows 10, version 1607,Windows 10, version 1809 and later, Windows Server 2012 R2 later

            Use /Boot to try and reduce the online configuration time that the OS spends during boot.
            Note that this optimization may be rendered invalid if any servicing operations are performed
            on the image after optimizing it.
     /WimBoot is for configuring an offline image for installing on a WIMBoot system.

    Examples: DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Optimize-Image /Boot
              DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Optimize-Image /WimBoot

    Applies one or more siloed provisioning packages (SPPs) to a specified image.
      This option is only available after running CopyDandI.cmd from the ADK, Version 1607 or later, and running
      dism.exe /Apply-SiloedPackage from the target folder created by CopyDandI.cmd.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage can only be run once against a Windows image, but /PackagePath can used more than once
      in the same command to apply multiple SPPs. SPPs will be applied in the specified order, so a dependency should
      be specified before the SPP that depends on it. see Siloed provisioning packages.

      /Apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:package_path /ImagePath:applied_image_path

      /PackagePath - Specifies the path of a siloed provisioning package file.
      /ImagePath - Specifies the path of the Windows image where you are applying the SPP.
    Example: 
      DISM.exe /apply-SiloedPackage /PackagePath:C:\\test\\Word.spp /PackagePath:C:\\test\\spp2.spp /ImagePath:C:\\

   /Split-Ffu /ImageFile:path_to_image_file /SFUFile:path_to_sfu
      /FileSize:MB-Size [/CheckIntegrity] 

     /FileSize - The maximum size in megabytes (MB) for each created file. 
                 If a single file is larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option, one of the
                 split .swm files that results will be larger than the value specified in the /FileSize option,
                 in order to accommodate the large file.

     /CheckIntegrity
                 Detect and track .wim file corruption when used with capture, unmount, export, and commit operations.
                 /CheckIntegrity stops the operation if DISM detects that the .wim file is corrupted when used
                 with apply and mount operations.

     /ImageFile  Specifies the path of a .FFU file, example: flash.ffu.
     /SFUFile    References split FFU files (SFUs). Pattern is the naming pattern and location of split files.

         This is the default mode for comparing files that have the following file extensions:
          .exe, .com, .sys, .obj, .lib, or .bin. 

   /C    Do a case insensitive string comparison

   /L    Compare the files in ASCII mode. Fc compares the two files line by line and attempts to resynchronize
         the files after finding a mismatch.
         This is the default mode for comparing non binary files, see /B. 

   /LBn  Set the n number of lines for the internal line buffer. The default length of the line buffer is 100 lines.
         If the files being compared have more than this number of consecutive differing lines, FC cancels the comparison. 

   /N    Display line numbers during an ASCII comparison.

   /T    Prevent FC from converting tabs to spaces.
         The default behavior is to treat tabs as spaces, with stops at each eighth character position.

   /U    Compares files as Unicode text files.

   /W    Compress white space (that is, tabs and spaces) during the comparison.
         If a line contains many consecutive spaces or tabs, /w treats these characters as a single space.
         When used with the /W command-line option, FC ignores (and does not compare) white space at the beginning and end of a line. 

   /nnnn   The a number of consecutive lines that must match before FC considers the files to be resynchronized.
           If the number of matching lines in the files is less than nnnn, FC displays the matching lines as differences.
           The default value is 2.

   /F:size         The size of the floppy disk to format (720, 1.2, 1.44, 2.88, or 20.8).

   /DAX[:state]    NTFS Only: Enable direct access storage (DAX) mode for this volume.
                   In DAX mode, the volume is accessed via the memory bus, boosting IO performance.
                   A volume can be formatted with DAX mode only if the hardware is DAX capable. 
                   State can specify "enable" or "disable".   * Windows 10+
                   /DAX is considered as /DAX:enable.

   /LogSize[:size] NTFS Only: The size for NTFS log file in kilobytes.
                   The minimum supported size is 2MB, so specifying size smaller than 2MB will
                   result in a 2MB log file.  Zero indicates the default value which generally
                   depend on the volume size.   * Windows 10+

   /NoRepairLogs   NTFS Only: Disable NTFS repair logs.   * Windows 10+
                   If the flag is set spotfix (i.e. chkdsk /spotfix) will not work.

   name  The File(s) or folder(s) the permissions will apply to.

   /T  Traverse all subfolders to match files/directories. This will apply permission changes to
       all subfolders whether or not they are set to inherit permissions from the parent. On very large

   /C  Continue on file errors (access denied) Error messages are still displayed.
  
   /L  Perform the operation on a symbolic link itself, not its target.

   /Q  Quiet - supress success messages.

   /grant :r user:permission
       Grant access rights, with :r, the permissions
       will replace any previouly granted explicit permissions (for the given user).
       Otherwise the permissions are added.

   /deny user:permission
       Explicitly deny the specified user access rights.
       This will also remove any explicit grant of the 
       same permissions to the same user.

   /remove[:[g|d]] User 
       Remove all occurrences of User from the acl. 
       :g remove all granted rights to that User/Sid.
       :d remove all denied rights to that User/Sid.

   /inheritance:e|d|r
          e - Enable inheritance
          d - Disable inheritance and copy the ACEs 
          r - Remove all inherited ACEs

   /setintegritylevel [(CI)(OI)]Level 
       Add an integrity ACE to all matching files. 
       level is one of L,M,H (Low Medium or High)

             Mandatory Label\\Low Mandatory Level    = Low.
             Mandatory Label\\Medium Mandatory Level = Medium/Standard.
             Mandatory Label\\High Mandatory Level   = Elevated.

             If No mandatory label is displayed in the output, it is Medium by default. 

       A Directory Inheritance option for the integrity ACE can precede the level
       and is applied only to directories:

   user   A user account, Group or a SID

   /restore  Apply the acls stored in ACLfile to the files in directory

   permission is a permission mask and can be specified in one of two forms:
        a sequence of simple rights:

                R - Read-only access
                W - Write-only access
        a comma-separated list in parentheses of specific rights:
                DE - Delete
                RC - read control
                WDAC - write DAC
                WO - write owner
                S - synchronize
                AS - access system security
                MA - maximum allowed
                GR - generic read
                GW - generic write
                GE - generic execute
                GA - generic all
                RD - read data/list directory

   source         File to compress.

   destination    File name to give compressed file.  If omitted, the
                  last character of the source file name is replaced
                  with an underscore (_) and used as the destination.

   /F directives  A file containing directives for MAKECAB to use (may be repeated).
                  If more than one directive file is specified (/F file1 /F file2 ...), they
                  are processed in the order (left to right) specified on the command line.

                  Variable settings, open cabinets, open disks, etc. are all carried forward
                  from one directive file to the next (just as if all of the files had been
                  concatenated together and presented as a single file to MakeCAB).
                  For example, this is intended to simplify the work for a product shipped in
                  multiple languages. There would be a short, language-specific directives file, 
                  and then a single, master directives file that covers the bulk of the product.

   /D var=value   Defines variable with specified value. (may be repeated).
                  Equivalent to using .Set in a directives file.
                  For example, a single directive file could be used to produce layouts
                  for different disk sizes by running MakeCAB once with different values of
                  MaxDiskSize defined: /D MaxDiskSize=1.44M. Both standard MakeCAB variables
                  and custom variables can be defined in this way.

                  If .Option Explicit is specified in a directive file,
                  then variable must be defined with a .Define command in a directive file.
                  To use a variable substitution (as in the directive file with %)
                  use double %%

   /L dir         Folder location to place destination file (default is current directory).
                  most useful when destination is not specified.

   /query   Report on the state of the secure channel the last time you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)

   /repl    Force synchronization with the primary domain controller (PDC).
            Nltest synchronizes only changes that are not yet replicated to the backup
            domain controller (BDC). NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sync    Force an immediate synchronization with the PDC of the entire SAM database.
            NT 4.0 BDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

            NT 4.0 PDCs only, not for Active Directory replication.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_query: DomainName
             Report on the state of the secure channel the last time that you used it.
            (The secure channel is the one that the NetLogon service established.)
            This parameter lists the name of the domain controller that you queried on the
            secure channel, also.

   /sc_reset:[ DomainName]
            Remove, and then rebuild, the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_verify:[ DomainName]
            Check the status of the secure channel that the NetLogon service established.
            If the secure channel does not work, this parameter removes the existing channel, and
            then builds a new one. You must have administrative credentials to use this parameter.

   /sc_change_pwd:[ DomainName]
            Change the password for the trust account of a domain that you specify.
            If you run nltest on a domain controller, and an explicit trust relationship exists,
            then nltest resets the password for the interdomain trust account.
            Otherwise, nltest changes the computer account password for the domain that you specify.

   /dclist:[ DomainName]
            List all DCs in the domain.
            This command first queries Active Directory for a list of DCs.
            If this query is unsuccessful, nltest then uses the Browser service (if netbios is enabled).

   /dcname:[ DomainName]
            List the primary domain controller or the PDC emulator for DomainName.

   /dsgetdc:[ DomainName]
            Query the Domain Name System (DNS) server for a list of DCs and their
            IP addresses. This parameter also contacts each domain controller to check for connectivity.
            The following list shows the values that you can use to filter the list of DCs
            or specify alternate names types in the syntax.

            /PDC: Return only the PDC (Windows NT 4.0) or domain controllers designated as the PDC
                  emulator (Windows 2000 and later).
            /DS:  Return only those DCs that are Windows 2000 and later.
            /DSP: Return only Windows 2000 and later DCs. If the query finds no such server,
                  then return Windows NT 4.0 DCs.
            /GC:  Return only those DCs that are designated as global catalog servers.
            /KDC: Return only those DCs that are designated as Kerberos key distribution centers.
            /TIMESERV: Return only those DCs that are designated as time servers.
            /GTTIMESERV: Return only DCs designated as master time servers.
            /WS: /NetBIOS: Specifies computer names in the syntax as NetBIOS names.
            /DNS: Specify computer names in the syntax as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
                  If you do not specify a return format, the DC can return either NetBIOS or DNS format.
            /IP:  Return only DCs that have IP addresses. i.e. return only TCP/IP DCs.
            /FORCE: Force the computer to run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in
                    the cache for the information.
            /Writable: Require that the returned DC be writable; All Windows 2000 DCs are writable
            /Avoidself: When called from a DC, specifies that the returned DC name should
                        not be the current computer. If the current computer is not a DC, this flag is ignored.
                        This flag can be used to obtain the name of another DC in the domain.
            /LDAPOnly: Specifies that the server returned is an LDAP server. The server returned is not
                       necessarily a DC. This flag can be used with the DS_GC_SERVER_REQUIRED flag
                       to return an LDAP server that also hosts a global catalog server.
                       If this flag is specified, the DS_PDC_REQUIRED, DS_TIMESERV_REQUIRED, 
                       DS_GOOD_TIMESERV_PREFERRED, DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_PREFERED,
                       DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICES_REQUIRED, and DS_KDC_REQUIRED flags are ignored.
            /Backg: If the DS_FORCE_REDISCOVERY flag is not specified, this function uses cached DC data.
                    If the cached data is more than 15 minutes old, the cache is refreshed by pinging
                    the DC. If this flag is specified, this refresh is avoided even if the cached data
                    is expired. This flag should be used if the DsGetDcName function is called periodically.
            /DS_6: Require that the returned DC be running Windows Server 2008 or later.
            /DS_8: Require that the returned domain controller be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
            /Try_Next_Closest_Site: When this flag is specified, DsGetDcName attempts to find a DC in
                                    the same site as the caller.
            /Ret_DNS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                      of DomainControllerInfo should be DNS names.
            /Ret_NETBIOS: Specifies that the names returned in the DomainControllerName and DomainName members
                          of DomainControllerInfo should be flat names.

   /dnsgetdc: DomainName
            Query the DNS server for a list of domain controllers and their corresponding IP addresses.
            values that you can use to filter the list of DCs:
               /PDC: Return only those DCs that are PDCs (Windows NT 4.0) or designated as PDC emulators.
               /GC:  Return only those DCs that you designate as global catalogs.
               /KDC: Return only those DCs that you designate as Kerberos key distribution centers.
               /WRITABLE: Return only those DCs that can accept changes to the directory database.
                          This value returns all Active Directory DCs, but not Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.
               /LDAPONLY: Return servers that are running a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) application.
                          The servers can include LDAP servers that are not DCs.
               /FORCE:    Run the command against the DNS server instead of looking in cache.
               /SITE Sitename: Sort to list first the records that pertain to Sitename.
               /SITESPEC:      Filter the returned records to display only Sitename, used only with /SITE.

   /dsgetfti: DomainName[ /UpdateTDO]
            Return information about interforest trusts. You use this parameter only for a Windows Server 2008
            domain controller that is in the root of the forest. If no interforest trusts exist, this parameter
            returns an error. The /UpdateTDO value updates the locally stored information on the interforest trust.

   /dsgetsite
            Return the name of the site in which the DC resides.

   /dsgetsitecov
            Return the name of the site that the DC covers. A DC can cover a site
            that has no local DC of its own.

   /parentdomain
            Return the name of the parent domain of the server.

   /dsregdns
            Refreshe the registration of all DNS records that are specific to a DC that you specify.


   /dsderegdns: DnsHostName
            Deregisters DNS host records for the host that you specify in the DnsHostName parameter.
            values you can use to specify which records nltest deregisters:
               /DOM:  Specify a DNS domain name for the host to use when you search for records on the DNS server.
                      If you do not specify this value, nltest uses the DNS domain name as the suffix of the
                      DnsHostName parameter.
               /DSAGUID: Deletes Directory System Agent (DSA) records that are based on a GUID.
               DOMGUID: Deletes DNS records that are based on a globally unique identifier (GUID).

   /whowill: Domain/ User
            Find the DC that has the user account that you specify. Use this parameter to determine
            whether nltest has replicated the account information to other DCs.

   /finduser: User
            Find the directly-trusted domain that the user account User belongs to.
            Use this parameter to troubleshoot logon issues of older client operating systems.

   /transport_notify    Flushe the negative cache to force the discovery of a domain controller.
                        You can use this parameter for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers only.
                        This operation is done automatically when clients log on to Windows 2000 and
                        Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.
   /dbflag: HexadecimalFlags
            Set a new debug flag. For most purposes, use 0x2000FFFF as the value for HexadecimalFlags.
            The entry in the Windows Server 2003 registry for debug flags is
            HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Netlogon\\Parameters\\DBFlag.

   /user: UserName
            Display many of the attributes that you maintain in the SAM account database for the user that
            you specify. You cannot use this parameter for user accounts that are stored in an AD database.

   /time: HexadecimalLSL HexadecimalMSL
            Convert Windows NT Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time to ASCII. HexadecimalLSL is a hex value for
            least significant longword. HexadecimalMSL is a hexa value for most significant longword.

   /logon_query
            Query the cumulative number of NTLM logon attempts at a console or over a network.

   /domain_trusts
            Returns a list of trusted domains. /Primary /Forest /Direct_Out /Direct_In /All_Trusts /v.
            values that you can use to filter the list of domains:
               /Primary: Return only the domain to which the computer account belongs.
               /Forest: Return only those domains that are in the same forest as the primary domain.
               /Direct_Out: Return only the domains that are explicitly trusted with the primary domain.
               /Direct_In: Return only the domains that explicitly trust the primary domain.
               /All_Trusts: Return all trusted domains.
               /v: Display verbose output, including any domain SIDs and GUIDs that are available.

   /dsquerydns
            Query for the status of the last update for all DNS records that are specific to a DC.

   /bdc_query: DomainName
            Query for a list of BDCs in DomainName, and then display their state of synchronization
            and replication status. You can use this parameter only for Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.

   /sim_sync: DomainName ServerName
            Simulate full synchronization replication. This is a useful parameter for test environments.

   /list_deltas: FileName
            Display the contents of the FileName change log file, which lists changes to the user account 
            database. Netlogon.chg is the default name for this log file, which resides only on Windows NT 4.0 BDCs.

   /cdigest: Message /domain: DomainName
            Display the current digest that the client uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest that is based on the previous password, also. Nltest uses
            the secure channel for logons between client computers and a domain controller, or for
            directory service replication between domain controllers. You can use this parameter in
            conjunction with the /sdigest parameter to check the synchronization of trust account passwords.

   /sdigest: <Message> /rid: RID_In_Hexadecimal
            Display the current digest that the server uses for the secure channel.
            (The digest is the calculation that nltest derives from the password.)
            This parameter displays the digest for the previous password, also. If the digest from the
            server matches the digest from the client, then nltest synchronizes the passwords that it
            uses for the secure channel. If the digests do not match, then nltest might not have replicated
            the password change yet.

   /shutdown: Reason [Seconds]
            Remotely shut down the server that you specify in ServerName.

Key:

   -a   Avoid outage. Requires -r. If the trigger will cause the target to suspend for a 
        prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent dump limit, the trigger will be skipped.

   -b   Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them).

   -c   CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process.

   -cl  CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process.

   -d   Invoke the minidump callback routine named MiniDumpCallbackRoutine of the specified DLL.

   -e   Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception. Include the 1 to
        create dump on first chance exceptions.

   -f   Filter the first chance exceptions. Wildcards (*) are supported. To just display the
        names without dumping, use a blank ("") filter.

   -g   Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop).

   -h   Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds).

   -i   Install ProcDump as the AeDebug postmortem debugger.
        Only -ma, -mp, -d and -r are supported as additional options.

   -l   Display the debug logging of the process.

   -m   Trigger a dump when memory commit reaches this threshold value (in MB).

   -ma  Write a dump file with all process memory. The default dump format only includes thread
        and handle information.

   -ml  Trigger when memory commit drops below specified threshold value (in MB).

   -mp  Write a dump file with thread and handle information, and all read/write process memory.
        To minimize dump size, memory areas larger than 512MB are searched for, and if found,
        the largest area is excluded. A memory area is the collection of same sized memory allocation
        areas. The removal of this (cache) memory reduces Exchange and SQL Server dumps by over 90%.

   -n   Number of dumps to write before exiting.

   -o   Overwrite an existing dump file.

   -p   Trigger on the specified performance counter when the threshold is exceeded.
        Note: to specify a process counter when there are multiple instances of the process running,
        use the process ID with the following syntax: "\\Process(name_pid)\\counter"

   -pl  Trigger when performance counter falls below the specified value.

   -r   Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5).
        CAUTION: a high concurrency value can impact system performance.
          Windows 7   : Uses Reflection. OS doesn\'t support -e.
          Windows 8.0 : Uses Reflection. OS doesn\'t support -e.
          Windows 8.1+: Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported.

   -s   Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).

   -t   Write a dump when the process terminates.

   -u   Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with -c).
        As the only option, Uninstalls ProcDump as the postmortem debugger.

   -w   Wait for the specified process to launch if it\'s not running.

   -x   Launch the specified image with optional arguments.
        If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start on the next activation (only).

   -64  By default ProcDump will capture a 32-bit dump of a 32-bit process when running on 64-bit Windows.
        This option overrides to create a 64-bit dump. Only use for WOW64 subsystem debugging.

          Sets the renewal interval in minutes for activated clients to attempt KMS connection.
          The renewal interval must be between 15 minutes and 30 days.
          This option is set initially on both the KMS server and client sides.
          The default is 10080 minutes (7 days).

   /spri  Set the KMS priority to normal (default).

   /cpri  Set the KMS priority to low.
          Use this option to minimize contention from KMS in a co-hosted environment.
          Note that this could lead to KMS starvation, depending on what other applications
          or server roles are active. Use with care.

   /sprt port
          Set the port on which the KMS host listens for client activation requests. The default TCP port is 1688.

      SORT [options] 

Options

   /+n   Sort the file ignoring the first one or more characters in each row.
         The default (/+1) will sort using all characters in each row.
          /+2 will start comparing at the second character, /+3 the third etc.
         Lines with fewer than n characters collate before other lines.

   /C[ASE_SENSITIVE]

         Case sensitive sort. (undocumented switch in Win7 and above)
         Dependent on the locale some characters will sort before A (\'- !#) or after Z (~£¬Ξ)

  [drive:][pathname]

         The file to be sorted.
         If not specified, the standard input is sorted.
         Specifying an input file is faster than redirecting the same file as standard input.

   /L[OCALE] locale

         Override the system default locale with the specified one.
         The "C" locale yields the fastest collating sequence and is currently the only alternative.
         The default sort with the C locale is case insensitive, so will not consistently place \'A\' before or after \'a\'.
         When both the C locale and Case-Sensitive are specified, all capitals will sort before lower case, so Z before a.
         The C locale is not the same collation as LC_ALL=C in Unix.

   /M[EMORY] kilobytes

         The amount of main memory to use for the sort, in KiB.
         The best performance is usually achieved by not specifying a memory size.

         The memory size is always constrained to be a minimum of 160 KiB.
         If the memory size is specified the exact amount will be used for the sort,
         regardless of how much main memory is available.

         By default the sort will be done with one pass (no temporary file) if it fits in the
         default maximum memory size, otherwise the sort will be done in two passes
         (with the partially sorted data being stored in a temporary file) such that the
         amount of memory used for both the sort and merge passes are equal.  The default
         maximum memory size is 90% of available main memory if both the input and output are
         files, and 45% of main memory otherwise.

         SORT will only create a temporary file when required by limitations in available memory.

   /REC[ORD_MAXIMUM] characters 

         The maximum number of characters in a row or record
         (default 4096, maximum 65535)

   /R[EVERSE]  Reverse the sort order (Z to A, 9 to 0)

   /T[EMPORARY] [drive:][path]

         The path of the directory to hold SORT\'s working storage, in case the data does not fit in RAM.
         The default is the system temporary directory %temp%

   /O[UTPUT] [drive:][pathname]

         The file where the sorted input is to be stored.
         If not specified, the data is written to standard output.
         Specifying an output file is faster than redirecting standard output to the same file.

   /U[NI_OUTPUT]
         Output in unicode. (undocumented switch in Win7 and above)

   /UNIQ[UE]
         Output only unique lines (undocumented switch in Windows 10 and above)', 'cmd');

      ssh [options] destination [command]

Options
   -4    Use IPv4 addresses only.
   -6    Use IPv6 addresses only.

   -A    Enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
   -a    Disable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

   -B bind_interface
         Bind to the address of bind_interface before attempting to connect to the destination host.
         This is only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -b bind_address
         Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.
         Only useful on systems with more than one address.

   -C    Use data compression.

   -c cipher_spec
         Select the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

   -D [bind_address:]port
         Dynamic application-level port forwarding.
         This allocates a socket to listen to port on the local side.
         When a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel,
         and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

   -E log_file
         Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

   -e escape_char
         Set the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
         The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character
         followed by a dot (.) closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection;
         and followed by itself sends the escape character once.
         Setting the character to \'none\' disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent. 

   -F configfile
         Specifies a per-user configuration file.
         The default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

   -f    Request ssh to go to background just before command execution.
         Useful if ssh is going to ask for a passwords, but the user wants it in the background.
         This implies -n. A recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is ssh -f host xterm.

         If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to \'yes\', then a client started with -f 
         will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background.

   -G    Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and Match blocks and exit.

   -g    Allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
         If used on a multiplexed connection, then this option must be specified on the master process. 

   -I pkcs11
         Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token
         providing keys for user authentication. 

   -i identity_file
         A file from which the identity key (private key) for public key authentication is read.

   -J [user@]host[:port]
         Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the pjump host[(/iam/jump-host)
         and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.

   -K    Enable GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -k    Disable forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server. 

   -l login_name
         The user to log in as on the remote machine.

   -M    Place the ssh client into \'master mode for connection sharing.
         Multiple -M options places ssh into \'master\' mode but with confirmation required using ssh-askpass(1)
         before each operation that changes the multiplexing state (e.g. opening a new session). 

   -m mac_spec
         A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms, specified in order of preference.

   -N    Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports. 

   -O ctl_cmd
         Control an active connection multiplexing master process.
         When the -O option is specified, the ctl_cmd argument is interpreted and passed to the master process.
         Valid commands are: \'check\' (check that the master process is running), \'forward\' (request forwardings
         without command execution), \'cancel\' (cancel forwardings), \'exit\' (request the master to exit),
         and \'stop\' (request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).

   -o option
         Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file. 

   -p port
         Port to connect to on the remote host.

   -Q query_option
         Query ssh for the algorithms supported for the specified version 2. The available features are:
         cipher (supported symmetric ciphers), cipher-auth (supported symmetric ciphers that support authenticated
         encryption), help (supported query terms for use with the -Q flag), mac (supported message integrity codes),
         kex (key exchange algorithms), key (key types), key-cert (certificate key types), key-plain (non-certificate
         key types), protocol-version (supported SSH protocol versions), and sig (supported signature algorithms). 

   -q    Quiet mode.
       
   -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
   -R [bind_address:]port:local_socket
   -R remote_socket:host:hostport
   -R remote_socket:local_socket
   -R [bind_address:]port
         Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded
         to the local side. 
         Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. Privileged ports can be forwarded only when
         logging in as root on the remote machine. Specify IPv6 addresses be enclosing the address in square brackets.

   -S ctl_path
         Specifies the location of a control socket for connection sharing, or the string \'none\' to disable connection sharing.
         Refer to the description of ControlPath and ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

   -T    Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

   -t    Force pseudo-terminal allocation.
         This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful,
         e.g. when implementing menu services. Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

   -V    Display the version number.

   -v    Verbose mode.

   -W host:port
         Request that standard input and output on the client be forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.
         Implies -N, -T, ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings, though these can be overridden in the configuration
         file or using -o command line options.

   -w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
         Request tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4) devices between the client (local_tun) and
         the server (remote_tun). The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword \'any\', which uses the next
         available tunnel device. If remote_tun is not specified, it defaults to \'any\'.
         See also the Tunnel and TunnelDevice directives in ssh_config(5).

         If the Tunnel directive is unset, it will be set to the default tunnel mode, which is \'point-to-point\'.
         If a different Tunnel forwarding mode it desired, then it should be specified before -w.

   -X    Enable X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.
         X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
         host (for the user\'s X authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded
         connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.

         For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
         Please refer to the ssh -Y option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.

   -x    Disable X11 forwarding. 

   -Y    Enable trusted X11 forwarding. Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls. 
   -y    Send log information using the syslog(3) system module. By default this information is sent to stderr.', 'cmd');

  -addtarget     Storage location for backups. A disk, volume, or UNC path.
  -allCritical   Include all critical volumes in the backups. Use only with -backupTarget. Can be used with -include.
  -allowDeleteOldBackups  Overwrite any backups made before the computer was upgraded.
  -authsysvol    If used, performs an authoritative restore of SYSVOL (the System Volume shared directory).
  -autoReboot    Restart the system at the end of the system state recovery operation.
                 This parameter is valid only for a recovery to the original location.
                 We do not recommend you use this parameter if you need to perform steps after the recovery operation.

  -backupTarget  The storage location for this backup. Requires an HD drive letter, a volume GUID-based path or UNC path.

  -exclude       A comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup: files, folders, or volumes.
  -include       A comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup: multiple files, folders, or volumes.

  -excludeDisks  Valid only when specified with -recreateDisks and must be input as a comma-delimited list of disk identifiers
                 (as listed in the output of wbadmin get disks). Excluded disks are not partitioned or formatted.
                 This parameter helps preserve data on disks that you do not want modified during the recovery operation.

  -hyperv        A comma-delimited list of components to be included in backup.
                 The identifier could be a component name or component GUID (with or without braces).

  -machine       The computer that you want backup details for. Use when backups of multiple computers are stored together.

  -nonRecurseExclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to exclude from the backup.
  -nonRecurseInclude   Non-recursive, comma-delimited list of items to include in the backup. 
                       Use only with the -backupTarget parameter.

  -noRollForward Valid only when recovering applications. Allows for previous point-in-time recovery of an application
                 if the latest version from the backups is selected.
                 For other versions of the application that are not the latest, previous point-in-time recovery is done as the default.

  -noVerify      Specifies that backups saved to removable media (such as a DVD) are not verified for errors.
  -noInheritAcl  Apply the access control list (ACL) permissions that correspond to the credentials provided by the
                  -user and -password parameters to the folder that contains the backup.

  -overwrite     Valid only when recovering files. If a file being recovered already exists:
                     Skip       - Skip the existing file and continue with recovery of the next file.
                     CreateCopy - Create a copy of the existing file so that the existing file is not modified.
                     Overwrite  - Overwrite the existing file with the file from the backup.

  -recoveryTarget  The location to restore to. Use if this location is different than the location that was previously backed up.

  -recreateDisks Recover a disk configuration to the state that existed when the backup was created.
                 Warning: This parameter deletes all data on volumes that host operating system components.
                 It might also delete data from data volumes.

  -recursive     Valid only when recovering files. Recover the files in the folders and all sub-folders.
                 By default, only files which reside directly in the specified folders are recovered.

  -restoreAllVolumes  Recover all volumes from the selected backup. If this parameter is not specified, only critical volumes
                 (volumes that contain the system state and operating system components) are recovered.
                 This parameter is useful when you need to recover non-critical volumes during system recovery.

  -schedule      Times of day to create a backup, formatted as HH:MM and comma delimited.
  -showsummary   Report the summary of the last system state recovery (after the restart required to complete the operation).
                 This parameter cannot be accompanied by any other parameters.

  -skipBadClusterCheck   Skip checking the recovery disks for bad cluster information. If you are restoring to an alternate
                 server or hardware, we recommend that you do not use this parameter.
                 You can manually run chkdsk /b on your recovery disks at any time to check them for bad clusters, and then
                 update the file system information accordingly.
                 Warning: Until you run chkdsk the bad clusters reported on your recovered system may not be accurate.

  -systemState   Create a backup that includes the system state in addition to items specified with the -include.

  -user          The user with write permission to the backup storage destination.
                 A member of the Administrators group or Backup Operators group on the computer being backed up.
  -password      The password for -user.

  -version       The version of the backup in MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM format. To view version information, type \'wbadmin get versions\'.

  -vssFull       Perform a full back up using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
                 All files are backed up, each file\'s history is updated to reflect that it was backed up, and the logs
                 of previous backups may be truncated.
                 Do not use this parameter if you are using a product other than Windows Server Backup to back up applications
                 that are on the volumes included in the current backup. Doing so can potentially break the incremental,
                 differential, or other type of backups that the other backup product is creating because the history that
                 they rely on might be missing and they might perform a full backup unnecessarily.

Options:

   /backup filename
      Back up the repository to the specified file name.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the file location.
      This process requires a write lock on the repository so that write operations to the repository are suspended
      until the backup process is completed.
      If you do not specify a path for the file, it is saved to the %Windir%\\System32 directory.

   /restore filename restore-mode
      Manually restore the WMI repository from the specified backup file.
      The filename argument should contain the full path to the backup file location.
      To perform the restore operation, WMI saves the existing repository to write back if the operation fails.
      Then the repository is restored from the backup file that is specified in the filename argument.
      If exclusive access to the repository cannot be achieved, existing clients are disconnected from WMI.

      The restore_mode flag must be a 1 (force disconnect users and restore)
      or 0 (default restore if no users connected).

   /resyncperf winmgmt-service-process-id
      Register the computer\'s performance libraries with WMI. WMI PID is the process ID for the WMI service.
      Only needed if the performance monitor classes are not returning reliable results.

   /standalonehost [level]
      Move the Winmgmt service to a standalone Svchost process that has a fixed DCOM endpoint.
      The default endpoint is "ncacn_ip_tcp.0.24158". However, the endpoint may be changed by running Dcomcnfg.exe.
      For more information about setting up a fixed port for WMI, see Setting Up a Fixed Port for WMI.

      The level argument is the authentication level for the Svchost process. WMI normally runs as part of a shared service host and
      you cannot increase the authentication level for WMI alone.
      If level is not specified, the default is 4 (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT or WbemAuthenticationLevelPkt).

      You can run WMI more securely by increasing the authentication level to Packet Privacy
      (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY or WbemAuthenticationLevelPktPrivacy).
      The authentication levels for Visual Basic and scripting are described in WbemAuthenticationLevelEnum.
      For C++, see Setting the Default Process Security Level Using C++. For more information, see Maintaining WMI Security.

   /sharedhost
      Move the Winmgmt service into the shared Svchost process.

   /verifyrepository path
      Performs a consistency check on the WMI repository.
      When you add the /verifyrepository switch without the path argument, then the live repository currently used by WMI is verified.
      When you specify the path argument, you can verify any saved copy of the repository.
      In this case, the path argument should contain the full path to the saved repository copy. The saved repository should be a copy of the
      entire repository folder. For more information about errors returned by this command, see the Remarks section.

   /salvagerepository
      Perform a consistency check on the WMI repository, and if an inconsistency is detected, rebuild the repository.
      The content of the inconsistent repository is merged into the rebuilt repository, if it can be read.
      The salvage operation always works with the repository that the WMI service is currently using.
      For more information about errors returned by this command, see the Remarks section.
      % MOF files that contain the #pragma autorecover preprocessor statement are restored to the repository.

   /resetrepository
      The repository is reset to the initial state when the operating system is first installed.
      MOF files that contain the #pragma autorecover preprocessor statement are restored to the repository.

      winrs [-/SWITCH[:VALUE]] COMMAND

Key
   COMMAND    Any string that can be executed as a command in the cmd.exe shell.

           (All switches accept both short form or long form. For example both -r and 
            -remote are valid.)

   -r[emote]:ENDPOINT        The target endpoint using a NetBIOS name or the standard
                             connection URL: [TRANSPORT://]TARGET[:PORT].
                             If not specified  -r:localhost is used.

   -un[encrypted]            Messages to the remote shell will not be encrypted. This is useful for
                             troubleshooting, or when the network traffic is already encrypted using
                             ipsec, or when physical security is enforced.
                             By default the messages are encrypted using Kerberos or NTLM keys.
                             This switch is ignored when HTTPS transport is selected. 

   -u[sername]:USERNAME      Username. If -username is specified, -password must be as well.
                             If not specified Winrs will negotiate authentication or prompt. 

   -p[assword]:PASSWORD      Password. If not specified winrs will prompt for it.

   -d[irectory]:PATH         The starting directory for remote shell.
                             If not specified the remote shell will start in %USERPROFILE%.

   -env[ironment]:STRING=VALUE
                             A single environment variable to be set when shell starts.
                             This allows changing default environment for the shell.
                             Multiple occurrences of this switch can be used.

   -noe[cho]                 Disable echo. This might be necessary to ensure that user\'s answers
                             to remote prompts are not displayed locally. By default echo is "on".

   -nop[rofile]              Do not load the user\'s profile. By default the server will attempt to load
                             the user profile. If the remote user is not a local administrator on the
                             target system then this option will be required.

   -comp[ression]            Turn on compression.  Older installations on remote machines may
                             not support compression so it is off by default.

   -[use]ssl                 Use an SSL connection when using a remote endpoint. Specifying this instead
                             of the transport "https:" will use the default WinRM default port.

   /kb:#####   Uninstall a package led by using its KB number. Use only together with /uninstall.

   /quiet      Run Wusa.exe in quiet mode without user interaction. When the tool runs in quiet mode,

   /norestart  Prevent Wusa.exe from restarting the computer.
               The /norestart switch is ignored if the /quiet switch is not present.
               If you run Wusa.exe together with these two switches, you must manually restart the
               operating system after the installation is complete (if the installation requires a restart)

               For example, if the Windows6.0-KB934307-x86.msu file is in the D:\\934307 folder, type

         Do not include empty folders or subfolders.           /T /E will include empty folders and subfolders.
   /K    Copy attributes. XCOPY will otherwise reset read-only attributes.   /N    If at all possible, use only a short filename (8.3) when creating
         a destination file. This can be necessary when copying between disks
         that are formatted differently e.g NTFS and VFAT, or when archiving
